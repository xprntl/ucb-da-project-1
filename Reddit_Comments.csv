1,Successful,tezos,"Please, don't mistake an obvious inability to properly communicate for a ""strategy"".EDIT: Hoplite phalanx is outdated by about 2 thousand years, maybe more.Nice analogy."
2,Successful,tezos,This is friggin authoritarian china. They will do whatever they want. Party members are all corrupt. 
3,Successful,tezos,"Watch this 'old' video on bitcoin a couple of times and you will be a lot wiser: https://youtu.be/GP_eT6E4os8"
4,Successful,tezos,"Well, the Foundation is going out and putting a Hoplite Phalanx together.First the trumpet, then the charge!A slow, concerted communications strategy seems to be emerging.First, tactical; then, strategic.The long game is over the horizon."
5,Successful,tezos,"I tend to agree, depending on implementation, however, I am generally against ""ban everything, then allow some to come back arbitrarily"" rules as this might facilitate corruption."
6,Successful,tezos,"Little effect on existing ICOs. Should be good for crypto in the long run to have a little bit more regulation. Sad to say, but someone needs to protect the idiots from the scammers. Personally, I don't think idiots need protection.  However, it'd be great to see scammers behind bars. "
7,Successful,tezos,"1. All three work on different Blockchains. (Imagine three separate Internets, and you run on one but not the others, and they can not talk to each other). BitCoin & Ethereum use proof of work (they burn electricity to secure the chain); Tezos uses proof of stake (it submits blocks to validators who post a bond and swear that the block is true, or else if other nodes call them out for fake, they loose the bond). Since we are partial and fanatics, and you happen to be on a Tezos subreddit, you can just imagine which we think is the Blockchain íìber Alles.2. Too many. Focus on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos.3. Buy $100 worth and play. But don't take your kids's allowances. Whenever you make  a new wallet, do not use the wallet until you have saved the keys in three separate ways: printout, encrypted file on your machine, and encrypted file on the cloud. If you ever loose the keys, your $100M dollars of Bitcoin is irretrievably lost. If your machine ever crashes and and rats eat your paper wallet, you have an encrypted copy of the key on the cloud you can download anywhere in the world, and completely reconstruct your wallet, on any machine. DO NOT UNDERAPPRECIATE THIS.Treat a wallet's private key the way you would treat a $100,000 US Federal Reserve Note in your pocket. Loose itand it's turtles down to tears, and nothing and no one anywhere can save you.4. A wallet is a piece of software you run on your computer (a ""client""), and it is tied to one particular blockchain (see #1 above). A wallet is a window viewer onto the blockchain to allow you to see your particular transaction history on the chain. The heart of your wallet is a public key (which you can show to anyone so they can send you money) and a private key (which you should never reveal, not even to you cat). The public key is passive: it allows things to BE sent; the private key is active: it allows you to send. (With the public key, you can be utterly promiscuous; with the private key, you must take a vow of chastity). These keys are simply long strings of alpha-numbers that can not be guessed, except possibly by your cat. The only thing stored in your wallet are your private and public keys, nothing else, not even money or tokens. The balances and transaction history are  simply read off the blockchain at any moment and displayed. The blockchain is the account of record, not your wallet.Too may books, too many videos, too many websites. Make a friend. Or, speak to your cat.Welcome to Tezos. Stay."

10,Successful,tezos,"Do you think there is any limitation of current hardware in running Nano S / Blue tezos app with staking, voting etc?"
11,Successful,tezos,"Im not the OP but I heard about it from ""This Week In Startups"". "
12,Successful,tezos,"The sure as shit way to know that an ICO is complete bullshit is if they list the team with profile photos. It's like they're trying too hard to prove that their idea is trustworthy. That and the fact that their code base is basically a fork of a shitty prediction market app that runs off ethereum (that doesn't actually work) with no new commits. Furthermore I'd somehow doubt their white-paper has been submit for presentation at an academic conference (the main purpose of white-papers) and submit for peer review. Listing out technical specifications in a PDF document doesn't constitute a white-paper. "
13,Successful,tezos,"Looks like a sophisticated scam to me. The whitepaper is bullshit, the domain is registered with an ""identity protection service"". Then the pictures of the team members is obfuscated in a way that makes me believe they are stolen and no contact info to validate the existence of the team."
14,Successful,tezos,"With the recent news of China banning ICOs, it may be good for the value of Tezos (at least for the short-term) that it has that amendment capability built in."
15,Successful,tezos,I certainly hope Tezos doesn't turn into an unimaginative sewer of gambling apps.

20,Successful,tezos,"Guess my question was answered in the most recent thread! ICO first ""Bettingwin"" lol"
21,Successful,tezos,"Bingo!Not enough people are asking these questions.For a period I thought that critical thinking had met its demise (on this forum). There are three trustees/members (Johann Gevers, Diego Ponz, and Guido Schmitz-Krummacher), nothing else is known. Do your own research if you are interested in who these men are and whether you deem them trustworthy.Most people think that, somehow, they contributed to the Tezos blockchain or something like this. Not so simple.The contribution was to the Foundation, which can easily pay each of these three individuals multimillion $ salaries AFAIK since no rules had been publicly disclosed via easily accessible public venue.Maybe there is a piece of paper in german or french somewhere in Zug describing the Foundation charter and rules, who knows.Contemplate this."
22,Successful,tezos,"That doesn't sound encouraging, lol."

24,Successful,tezos,Probably scam.
25,Successful,tezos,News to me
26,Successful,tezos,I think this user is trying to say that Tezos can simply improve the protocol with the features that an ICO on the Tezos platform would bring. 
27,Successful,tezos,I didn't realize Tezos was giving business strategy to the coin owners. I thought we just voted on changes to the block chain?
28,Successful,tezos,Basically what ppl think will happen first on tezos... someone builds an ico or the holders vote in a change. We all know the xtz ico happened already lol
29,Successful,tezos,IDK what you are talking about the ICO already happend.
30,Successful,tezos,see you there :)

40,Successful,tezos,"I use a Mycelium software wallet for my Bitcoin transactions, and many times I've thought to myself how nice it would be if I could connect my wallet directly to my bank account so I could transfer dollars directly from my bank account into the wallet and then use those dollars to buy Bitcoin; Glidera (https://www.glidera.io/) attempts to solve this problem, but it's cumbersome and time-inefficient.I think the Tezos Foundation should use some of its contributions to support the development of a Tezos software wallet that can connect DIRECTLY to one's bank account."

73,Successful,tezos,"So who controls the funds in the non-profit and how much of the funds were sent there?

Since it isn't the Tezos holders that choose what to develop, who exactly is deciding what goes into marketing, R&D etc?"
74,Successful,tezos,"Yeah, me too. I think Tezos should pivot and become an ETH startup. That way they will add even more value to their precious ETH."

83,Successful,tezos,"I'm starting to love how the Breitmans and the Tezos Foundation are so bullish on ETH and BTC and so bearish on their own product.

Buy a couple of navy blue suits, fitting is key, they must fit your body well, this will also complement your physicque and make you look much better. 2. Wear a shirt with a wide collar and a large tie pulled tight, it's the corporate lawyer look, it will make you look powerful, knowledgable and impressive.3. Have a PowerPoint on in the background at all times, even if this is simply the Tezos graphics or a streaming image, the mind remembers brand and identity is key is this industry.4. Don't be fooled by fitting into this tech driven developer industry, your appearance is pretty embarrassing given you have just made over $100m upon completion of your white paper terms..5. Take my advice on your appearance, it will drive your public credibility astronomically higher, ensuring Tezos has a greater opportunity for success.6. You might be a developer and philanthropist at heart but I can assure you, appearance is key and at present you are only damanging the public opinion by looking like a college student.7. Only Steve Jobs pulled off the Joe Bloggs look.. Mark Zuckerberg is also an exception.. the difference is they were/are pinoneers within industry and have the top five bank balances to back up what their appearance represents.Don't take the comments to heart.. you need to change your appearance. Think big... "

133,Successful,tezos,"Probable, actually, that Estonia will consider launching on Tezos.  The Baltic countries are very advanced, progressive thinkers. They are vulnerable to loss of territory,  data (such as title deed and vital records) and control of infrastructure, as they have been mercilessly hacked. They are trying to preserve their sovereignty by locking it to things westward. I would not be surprised if they adopted a currency and platform that would not be destabilized, even going so far as to meld their sovereignty to either western countries, institutions or economic platforms.If Estonia were to attach itself to Tezos, expect massive attacks and hacking of the network.Because Tezos is so security-centric, it may be a better platform than any other for Estonia.But network security would need to be enormously resilient to accommodate political weather.This means extreme and massively distributed nodes, in the tens of millions."

295,Successful,tezos,"There is no market price because the tokens don't exist yet. There is an IOU and a futures market bitmex and HitBTC maybe others but because an IOU (that isnt a scam) would have a limited supply (however much the exchange bought using client funds) it may trade significantly higher than the eventual market price for the thing once all tokens are freely traded. A futures market doesn't give you any right to the actual token, its purely synthetic and comes with additional risks (there is a finite amount of collateral on the other side of the bet so the price cant go further than what that capital can sustain)Its really up to your own judgement as to whether futures or IOU prices reflect reality. I think they do to some extent but they can be regularly out by 10x either way. right now the bitmex price is 0.00044 and hitbtc its 0.000493 that is compared to 1/6000 = 0.00016666^^..I'm personally valuing my tokens at 1/6000 in my portfolio because it doesn't hurt to discount value but if I could sell right now i would not be selling at even hitbtc prices so there's that.

I suspect we will continue to see Etherium flaws and vulnerabilities (though I""m sure they will get them fixed) Tezos, having a better foundation is more likely to be implemented for 'financially sensitive' applications. (and usually everything in finance is sensitive) Also, similar to Dash, some of the money from inflation will be dumped right back into the development and promotion of this blockchain. Oh and it's sitting on a pile of cash right now also which is a pretty good spot to be in! I think you will see an unmatched agility with Tezos from its original design and 'self amending' properties. It has the resources and underlying architecture to morph however it needs to to meet future needs. "

Founders and early investors have large stakes and as long as developers can deliver on what's been spelled out in the position and white papers there's likely to be a large voting block. This is not a bad thing as it will prevent voter apathy and development stalling.They say bitcoin works better in practice than in theory so it seems the same might to apply to Tezos.6.1 COMMUNITY GOALS of the Tezos Overview as least provides ethos, intent and a mission statement and since this was printed well before the charitable funding we can only assume that people willing to support the Tezos community goals form the majority voting block."

444,Successful,tezos,"Well formal verification will be much easier in Tezos because Michelson is actually a high-level functional language with closures etc. (Also bignums help much.) Ethereum could have a similar language, but it would need a verified compiler to be ""100%"" trustworthy.For Ethereum, there are few projects for formal verification, eth-isabelle https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle and kEVM for K-framework https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics both can be used to verify EVM bytecode, and they are mostly complete, perhaps some details will still have to be added to kEVM.To make a verifiable compiler, there are few plans. One is to use CakeML https://cakeml.org/ and make that target EVM. Not sure how much work that would take. Another idea to have a more simple compiler would be to make a compiler for solidity inline assembler (this is actually an imperative language with loops, variables and functions, similar to WebAssembly, one of its compilation targets). This could then eventually be used to make a verified solidity compiler. But I only have verified that the compiler terminates so far. About the current state of formal verification for Tezos, there seems to be a semantics for Coq, but it doesn't seem to be completed yet. Other approaches should also be considered, like semantics for Isabelle and HOL4, and using to SMT based systems like F* and why3."

482,Successful,tezos,"They should develop the platform and then in a few years time if they still have excess funds they should dispose of the fnds in a way that aligns with their mandate as a Swiss foundation. That may mean returning excess funds to donators but realistically I would assume that excess funds would help the platform more if they went to token-holders at the time that they decide that spending any more money on infrastructure would be less effective than giving the funds away. This would not be unprecedented either, the Digix foundation gifted excess ETC to DGX token holders when they decided giving it away would be the best option. They did not decide that it should go to donators to their crowd sale. I don't expect the foundation to return any capital gains (or demand additional donations to make up for capital losses) from the volatile currencies they hold. I think its best to think of any equivalent to dividends or  stock splits the same way. If they do start returning funds I might even be a little concerned that they no longer fully believe in themselves as capable of investing in the platform in perpetuity...

595,Successful,tezos,No we just purchase a lot of coins during the ICO ourself and take advantage of volume discounts 
596,Successful,tezos,ICO sale completed long back
597,Successful,tezos,NO! I am not in favor of Tezos issuing an ERC-20 token just so people can dump their ico äóìdonationäó into the market. Use our donation to build a great platform and when the system is ready for prime time (I donäó»t care how long it takes) release the tokens.
598,Successful,tezos,Mathews never a strong point in my wisdom. Never very good at it. Also didnt realize it was an ether conv. I  like the 3.50 demand rate.  How do you have access to the coins ? Is this like a stubhub type model ?

601,Successful,tezos,"Why would anyone buy Tezos token from you for $3.7 per coin, when the IOU only cost $1.27? Even if this prove to not be a scam it's close to being a fraud."
602,Successful,tezos,"I know that buying during ico equals increased risk and price goes up as network launch approaches, but that price BEFORE network launches would be wonderful.

610,Successful,tezos,"Just did the math for you, its actually around $3.50 per coin"
611,Successful,tezos,"Hey so first, your conversion is wrong because we're selling in ether not BTC. Next, HitBTC doesn't actually have the access to any coins, we do.

612,Successful,tezos,Looks like they are post selling tezos for $50 a coin or .0125 btc. I could be wrong as i just put in some numbers in the buy form to see what the cost looked like. IOU trading on hitbtc is at $1.20. I know IOU trading is not an accurate value but i could only wish that my tezos was already trading at $50 as valued at this site.
613,Successful,tezos,How so?

615,Successful,tezos,"It will be voted in.STARKs are still years away. To the best of my knowledge, there is only a draft paper available which hasn't been peer-reviewed yet (and that I wasn't able to get my hands on) and a couple presentation of Eli Ben-Sasson in academic seminars and tech meetups (see: https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/elibensasson.pdf). And even if it had been published, there needs to be more R&D done to solve the high proof generation latency and get the implementation details right so it can be best used in Tezos. It's a hard computing problem.It clearly is on the roadmap though: https://hackernoon.com/scaling-tezo-8de241dd91bd"
616,Successful,tezos,Yeah I got the e-mail but my brother didn't and he had put in a tiny bit for the ICO for fun and I was trying to figure out why when I remembered that he only put his email in the offline website so there's no way they even know his email lol.
617,Successful,tezos,"You can't just bet $5 million, you're betting against the people betting that it'll be under the current futures price, so there has to be someone taking your bet on it.  If someone wants to bet millions against tezos then they can do that and you'd be able to take the bet."
618,Successful,tezos,"lol, it's not going to be $500K the first week of November.  Mind you, I bought a bunch of Tezos as well but it's unlikely to see any price close to that for a very long time.  If you really think it'll be worth $5 in Novemeber why aren't you buying the hell out of the futures for it?!  I think OP is just trying to get back the gains that BTC has had since the ICO."
619,Successful,tezos,"A few things, Polychain seems to have bet rather big on Tezos and their CEO was Coinbase's first employee. If nothing else, I'm sure the folks at Coinbase are keeping an eye out on Tezos.There was also a blog post on Medium by one of Coinbase's employees about Tezos-they blog about various cryptos.  But last time when they blogged about Litecoin it preceded Coinbase then adding Litecoin as a coin.  That said, they've also blogged about cryptos that didn't get added so it's not a guaranteed thing.So basically we know two things: 1)Folks at Coinbase are aware of Tezos and carefully following it, and 2)Their former first employee that now runs the largest blockchain hedge fund is a huge fan of Tezos. From these two facts I would venture the guess that multiple people who work at Coinbase invested in the Tezos ICO as well as I would find it hard to believe that you could follow it this closely and have a an influential former employee be such a fan without a lot of other folks at Coinbase also buying into it.So nothing is guaranteed but I think the odds of Tezos getting added to Coinbase is better than for most other new cryptos. And pretty obviously getting added to Coinbase would do huge things for Tezos' price, if you care about that sort of thing ;)I think I'm going to hold out and see if Coinbase manages to add it, if they do I would expect a price boost similar to how Litecoin got a huge boost from being legitimized by Conibase. Given how innovative Tezos is, a marketcap higher than that of Litecoin is plausible if this really happened.Either way the odds are going to be better than playing the lottery, lol."
620,Successful,tezos,Literally wait until first week of november and sell 103000 XTZ for $500k and no need for the home loan. Or wait another year and sell it for 1-1.5m.
621,Successful,tezos,"> lost nearly 300% compared to the bottomCould you clarify what you mean by this?"
622,Successful,tezos,"I am not sure I agree with this. If Tezos grows to encapsulate significant wealth then its not easy for tezos holders to just switch. Different parties will have different ideas on what is best (see recent BTC factions and battles for a taste of what we could be facing in a few years)I think that the ""tyranny of the majority"" is a potentially serious problem and is something we should put a lot of thought into as a community.Early on in any community you can rely on in-group norms and community standards to keep everyone aligned on the same page, but if Tezos grows to the size we all hope it does, I think it would not be wise to rely on community standards."

630,Successful,tezos,"Don't even read anything this human writes, he doesn't know jack shit about anything. That's real. "
631,Successful,tezos,"Stop using your computer. Clone the disk. Keep the clone in a safe place, label it and don't touch it anymore until you can have someone more experienced help you with the recovery. This is the blueprint of the state of your disk. If your seed is still somewhere, you'll be able to find it eventually with some help.Once it's cloned do a filesystem search for all files containing the word ""tezos"". If no pdf comes up, do a device level search for all pdf and open every pdf that has either a random looking name or a name that doesn't explicitly indicate this is not your Tezos file.If normal filesystem search doesn't yield anything, use a file recovery tool and have it write the recovered file to another disk, like a usb drive for instance. This is to prevent overwriting the ""dirty"" filesystem pages where the contents of your Tezos file may still be. Check all the pdf files that get recovered.The next thing if you still couldn't locate your file is to grep the raw drive volume for strings of characters that contain the word ""Tezos"" or ""tezos"" on the drive or any other recognizable string from the pdf file such as you password (the more specific the better). You'll get a lot of hexadecimal garbage with pieces of strings in between. Once you locate a string that looks like the Tezos file, look in the hexa garbage around and you should find your mnemonics. If you are out of luck the mnemonics won't be all on the same page and the next page may be located at a completely different place.If you could find any string with the raw search that looks like it belonged to the pdf file but couldn't locate all or any of the mnemonics, you need to extract all the strings from the raw volume and then filter the list by looking up each string in the BIP39 dictionary file. This is labour intensive so a script will be needed.If the first file system level steps don't work and you need to work on the raw volume, I would recommend using Linux as it comes with all the needed tools by default and is easy to script. You can download a live cd distribution and install it on a usb drive, then boot from that drive and mount your main drive as read only. If you are not familiar with Linux or what I'm describing sounds unfamiliar to you, find someone you can trust and who is proficient with Linux and ask him to help with doing the above.Most importantly, until you can clone your drive or find someone to help you do it stop using your PC. Any further action you do could be overwriting the location where your mnemonics are stored on the disk. Just shut down the PC completely."
632,Successful,tezos,I have the same doubts and I'm sure the team will prepare a detailed explanation on staking before the chain goes online. 
633,Successful,tezos,Yea well I don't consider those people worth their salt lol.  I wouldn't have developers like that building valuable smart contracts for me.
634,Successful,tezos,Stop being so useless.
635,Successful,tezos,"I guess it's a matter of how you define ""worth his salt"". C++ developers for instance are usually considered to be in the upper range of skills in the industry which is why they command the highest salaries, yet you'd be surprised how many experienced developers think they understand the language and yet don't have the slightest clue how what they write is going to be compiled and executed, what complexity the code they write has, or are mostly clueless about the remarkable higher order programming capabilities of he language such as template metaprogramming and lambda expressions when they even know that these features exist. Many developers are just lazy and content to be average. And don't get me started on the web and smartphone app developers who in the vast majority (there are always exceptions of course, no personal offense intended) just know to crank together spaghetti code and lack the most basic theoretical basis.These are the type of developers that will likely stick to Ethereum and Lisk because learning to code for Tezos requires too much effort. And I am glad OCaml will turn them off. It's not a short coming, it's a feature."
636,Successful,tezos,They will choose promising companies with minimum viable products to invest in.  It will help separate worthy platforms from all the shit ICOs popping up everywhere that get millions of dollars with nothing to show for it.  
637,Successful,tezos,"Really interesting scenario unique to ICOs, I think it does highlight the problem with investing in a company without an established product. With the traditional start up tech model, a payment schedule denotes when funds are received by companies and at what milestones. While ICOs marry the more conventional IPO model, leaving founders flushed with cash at the start. It is obvious the Tezos founders are now concerned with how to best manage and optimise their cash reserves and match it to their operational cashflows. This however, seems to add an extra layer of burden to the founders. My concern now is the ability and compensation of the would be fund manager. Additionally shouldn't later stage funding of the project come from sales of tezzies instead of ICO funds. It seems this may be a likely case of founders raising as much as possible without worrying about consequence. This will probably heavily impact the tradable value of tezzies on secondary exchanges.  "
638,Successful,tezos,Any developer worth his salt can easily learn a new language.  I had never worked with a functional language before and now I use one at work every day for a new project.  OCaml won't be any different.

640,Successful,tezos,"I think there will be quite some demand, actually.Judging from the amount of people asking the most basic questions on this subreddit during and after the fundraising, many won't have the patience to spin up a node, no matter how simple and accessible the instructions will be (which they will be, judging from how basic the videos were). Not compete noobs probably, just not tinkerers - big group!Then you have those who don't want to store anything themselves. Quite easy to set up a hardware wallet, yet so many people keep their stuff on coinbase, for example. Which nearly cost them BCH, probably any ether-related airdrops happening are also not released to clients, so also a percentage of the value is shared by the firm and not passed on. Again, thousands joining coinbase daily and the above doesn't stop them, at least for now."

686,Successful,tezos,OCaml is a functional programming language.

691,Successful,tezos,">2) What do the current amendment rules do about the ""tyranny of the majority"" and how efficient are they?You assume the concept of tyranny of the majority is a concept that applies to blockchains.Blockchains are voluntary systems. Discontents participants can sell and move to another chain or unite and fork, both of which will hurt the majority. For this reason, the majority has a strong economic incentive to self-restrain and achieve a win-win for all parties.There can't be a ""tyranny"" in a system where all participants choose voluntarily to participate."
692,Successful,tezos,"I think the idea still has merit, but the challenge, as in most things, is implementation. Many on-chain metrics are easier to manipulate than off-chain versions, but I think there are still combinations of metrics that could work. I think that the best option is to wait and see as I'm sure any proposal for Tezos to switch to a Futurarchy-based government will be accompanied by a proposal for the first welfare metric used. I don't think metrics like token price, transaction volume, or size of fees are perfect indicators, but a combination of these and other metrics could be used, potentially to create a better system for all users."
693,Successful,tezos,"OCaml is mostly used in computer science academia and private sector firms that hire in priority from the academia. Developers ""out there"" on the Internet who understand well functional programming and can code in OCaml or learn it easily are the minority. But is it a bad thing? Tezos being a self amending ledger implies higher order programming which requires a very different mindset from that of the average developer used to imperative programming. Tezos also seeks to have a maximum of critical code undergo formal verification using proofs that must be designed with a lot of thorny theoretical considerations in mind such as decidability. Formal verification is a subtle craft that requires a good understanding of computer science fundamentals.For all these reasons it's actually a very good thing that the language chosen for writing Tezos may feel very unfamiliar to the average developer. It clearly signals that some further study will be needed before one starts getting his hands dirty hacking the code. It also helps that it's nearly impossible to learn a functional programming language without at the same time picking up some deeper understanding of computer science fundamentals.     "

A few participants who contributed within the fundraiser window but had not yet registered their key contacted us, and we were able to include their contribution after their key was registered.

The Tezos foundation is an entity designed to foster the growth and innovation of the Tezos platform. It is not a for profit company. Allocating capital towards spurring the growth of OCaml and the Tezos ecosystem is an incredibly smart move, and nothing like paying people to use your product. It's just an incredibly short sighted article..."
858,Successful,tezos,"Hey - Sam here, CTO of BitMEX.Just wanted to chime in a bit about how this contract works. We've done this a few times before pre-ICO, such as on ZCash.Essentially, our system requires only a reference price to trade; since they're all cash-settled futures - aka settled in Bitcoin - we don't actually need to hold any physical XTZ to offer or settle this product. All that's required, by settlement time, is a price feed from a liquid XTZ market.BitMEX markets are always peer-to-peer and the exchange does not take positions on trades. You're always trading with another market participant.More about the contract structure is in the [XTZ Series Guide](https://www.bitmex.com/app/seriesGuide/XTZ). I hope that helps."
859,Successful,tezos,"If I'm right that BitMEX will pay out like they say they will (and if the market agrees), then the price of this contract represents the market's expectation of the future price of XTZ.The price in dollar terms is more than 2x what tezzies sold for in the ICO. So to any ICO participants who want to track how their investment is doing: you're currently sitting on a 100% return."

861,Successful,tezos,"It's an interesting criticism, not totally off base, but not well rounded in showing the other side of the argument.The Tezos Foundation has to operate in the fiat world to accomplish building out the network. Not many vendors and developers operate in virtual currencies. People still overwhelmingly have to pay their real world bills in fiat currencies.There will eventually come an inflection point where economies are so penetrated by virtual currencies, that operations can be planned and executed completely without fiat.As Tezos becomes more visible, expect more criticism and having to answer for choices we make. Let's  take it in stride and not be defensive. Anything that  becomes important and a utility in the economic life of people will be pummeled at times in the press and crypto sphere. Maybe we canmake our mascot a rhino.

Based on my contribution price (at the time) and the number of tezzies I was given, I think I worked out my cost per tezzie was $0.38.  If there were 100M tezzies in circulation, that gives this coin a market cap of $38M.  With 700M tezzies, it gives a market cap of $228M.  For better or worse, I think investors are using market cap to rate coins and determine how well that coin is doing compared to the cryptoverse.  So, if investors wanted Tezos on the same level as Ripple (for instance) the run-up would be must better starting from $38M.  I'm not saying that any of this is the way it should be, its just my observations so far.

999,Successful,tezos,sounds like a plausible scenario.
1000,Successful,tezos,Technically we will drop b/c many people will realize they made significant gains from the ICO date. There will be a sell off/ panic sell. But within 50-75 days we will explode up. See iota.

Then once the sift has ended (short-termers gone, tokens picked up by long-termers), we'll see a few months of stagnant prices followed by small bumps of 10% to 20% as the platform develops.

Also, Bitcoin's market cap is around $72 billion, so it's a lot closer to two times the current market cap, not that it really matters either way.Not saying that XTZ will reach that goal in a few years or ever, but honestly, bringing up Bitcoin's current market cap as a comparison just makes no sense. You can't use that to predict future alt coin prices, by then we could be talking about a $1 trillion market cap for bitcoin. Seems ridiculous, but I wouldn't be surprised.

You could try to gauge the potential value of Tezos or any other cryptocurrency in general by looking at the aggregate market value it is trying to enter into (that's where the 'Bitcoin will go to $500k' assessments come from). This will still leave you with only a very rough idea, however at least it provides some insight on what could be achieved if the project is successful. Tezos at $300 would put it at a $300B dollars fully diluted valuation (going off a 1B coin supply).

1048,Successful,tezos,"Tezos should be somewhere between 5-10 billion market cap, easy - on crack not to think so!  1. Blockchain/Technology is way beyond what anyone else is doing, and years in the works. It many ways, it should be miles ahead of Ether blockchain on day one. People/Business will want the more secure platform, with formal verification and ability to change without forking. IMHO, it just makes too much sense over current smart contract models for business not to look this way. 2. Venture fund triggering development. Money talks in dev space. As the development starts to be announced - and there should be much ($50 million worth) - it will be well received. 3. The ICO $. If they have about 500 million now, it could very well be 1 billion (doubled) by the the time they go live (3 months ?) the way crypto is exploding (BTC and ETH holdings). As well, they are investing some of the $ in traditional markets (bonds, metals, etc.)...which will form a firm backbone to further support the platform.  4. It's not just a coin, it's a platform...big difference.  Anyhow, there's little doubt in my mind where this will be when it starts, and in a year or two down the road.

1064,Successful,tezos,I'm looking at it as a percentage of $ETH market cap since they serve similar purposes. Having said that I think Tezos will have a $10 billionish market cap fairly soon.
1065,Successful,tezos,I think what might be helpful is to also have a graph which shows how other leading cryptocurrencies have started as market cap to reach their eventual valuations now.

Where you buy a stock, pray the company actually succeeds, wait six years, and maybe get 5x on your investment.People aren't in crypto to have that kind of investment.  And I hope it doesn't become the new norm. Everyone here got away from that for a reason. I'm literally tossing money into ICOs on a weekly basis, and getting 5 to 10x within 1 month. And that's what brought Filecoin here in the first place.  They wanted the instant funding, and the benefits. But they gave investors an investment structure that matches the slow, low-ROI stock world.  So in one sense it looks like they're making it more ""legitimate"". But in another sense they're just removing everything from the equation that makes this worthwhile for investors. Expensive ICO prices, long waits, slow returns.  Having to actually rely on the success of the company as a whole. That's not the ICO scene here. I don't have to worry that 0X Project actually succeeds in the long run. I made 6x within three weeks. Whether that is morally good or bad I don't know. But that's what this scene is.

1153,Successful,filecoin,"> IOPS. How can IOPS be promised on some old HD in someones basement?This is a good question.  How is a decentralized network ever going to compete with industrial data centers which will always be orders of magnitude faster and more reliable than consumer grade hardware accessed through residential connections?  If we ignore concerns over data security and we just focus purely on speed, then obviously it can't.  Centralized factory operations always beat cottage industries when it comes to absolute output.One scenario I could envision is that some company could build a datacenter, and then rent out storage space to customers.  Customers, in turn, could then offer storage space to the filecoin/sia/storj/etc network.  In theory, if this decentralized file system technology becomes popular enough, investors could raise enough capital to build their own private datacenters so that they can sell storage directly to the market."
1154,Successful,filecoin,"Yea, good point. No idea how exchanges would regulate. I do read that some folks are worried that SEC (in USA) *might* go after the exchanges for selling tokens that are *deemed* securities. So, perhaps this is a precursor to that possiblity."
1155,Successful,filecoin,That's just Kim Dotcom pretending he has a functional product when all he has is a pretty front end.
1156,Successful,filecoin,"I'm not making a general statement about ICOs that come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. My statement is specifically targeted at the Filecoin ICO that was designed in complete disregard of basic game theory principles. One of the main functions of ICOs is to anchor the price by creating a schelling point under which all ICO participants will consider that the price is ""too low"" and will refuse to sell hereby creating a very strong price floor. An ICO designed that way ensures that investors who bought at or under the schelling point will almost automatically make a positive return if the market maintains its initial hype. There are many strategies to create such a point. The most obvious one is to sell all tokens at the same price: this creates a rock solid, near unbreakable floor. Another strategy that incentivizes a bit more risk taking is to give a small bonus to earlier investors, large enough to encourage early commitment, but small enough to prevent the creation of two perceived price anchors. It's common to see 5~25% bonus given to all investors who come within a long enough time window to make sure that everyone who was actively looking to invest can get in. Long enough windows ensure that later comers are people who **genuinely** heared of the project later or are **genuinely** influenced by earlier comers. Later comers in such circumstances usually won't object to being considered ""late comers"" and invest at a slightly higher price. Early birds will also consider the discount a natural compensation for the risk they took, so that the entire cohort of investors early and late alike will likely adopt the final price tranche of the ICO as a schelling point hereby ensuring that all investors will see a positive return.A few example of high profile ICOs that succesfully implemented this strategy of a progressive, reasonable, fair and natural incentivization of early commitment are Ethereum or Tezos.Now, what's important to understand is that Filecoin completely messed up their pricing function by creating inconsistent incentives effectively creating a series of weak price anchors with a complete lack of widespread consensus among investors.The first huge mistake of this ICO was to exclude all non-accredited investors, even the non-US ones who were excluded for no good reason at all since no financial regulation actually mandates their exclusion. This reduced the pool of investors involved in the price discovery process to a few thousands at most, as compared to the legion of tens of thousands of investors this ICO could have attracted had the founders not been over-zealous in minimizing their legal exposure. The result is that not many of the people who will ultimately be trading FIL followed the ICO and have a well informed opinion of what would be a fair price for FIL based on what investors paid. Due to this, whatever price anchors are found by the ICO process are weak at best since they can and will be entirely ignored by the market that is mostly unaware of them.The second very bad idea was to allow only their cronies to invest in the presale (making early supporters feel left out), run the presale only two weeks before the ICO (therefore at no significantly higher risk), give the presale a massive and completely unjustified 40~50% discount as compared to the starting ICO price and allow cronies to invest as much as $55M for as much as 55% of the entire tokens available. This effectively set the de-facto fair price and hard price floor of the FIL token at $0.75, and created a strong feeling that any subsequent price levels are completely unjustified and illegitimate.The third **absolutely retarded idea** (which was partially dumped eventually, albeit extremely reluctantly) was to make the price of the ICO increase linearly with every dollar invested to up to 4x the starting price of the ICO. The reason that this is (sorry to insist) **deeply retarded** to anyone with even the slightest understanding of game theory and price formation theory is that **it prevents the creation of a schelling point**. When not a single investor pays the same price, how can the market converge to any estimation of what would be a fair price? This would have prevented the creation of a second price anchor, and reinforced $0.75 as the one and only valid price anchor. This would also have discouraged most investors from investing at all.Thanks to widespread investors outrage, founders backed off, and settled for a slightly less damaging, but still amazingly stupid solution that consisted on averaging all investments in the first hour. This resulted in the investment of $145M at $2.63 hereby creating a second price anchor at $2.63 and making the third stage start at an outrageous $4.95! Now the retarded princing mechanics that was supposed to apply to the entire ICO is being applied to the third stage: the price is increasing linearly from $4.95 to $6. No price anchor will be created in that range due to the linear distribution of investments and the small amount of tokens sold in that phase. That means that the system is going to be structured on two points of equilibrium: $2.63 supported by a monetary mass of 55M token (28% of the total supply) and $0.7 supported by a monetary mass of 110M token (56% of the total supply). The higher price floor will hold only so long as presale investors refrain from selling at or under $2.63 which is far from being guaranteed given that $2.63 is an immediate 250% risk free profit. Eventually, if FIL fails to undergo a significant price appreciation, more and more presale investors and ICO investors alike may be temptated to recoup some of their investment, at costing price for ICO investors and at a 250% profit for presale investors. This could lead to the breach of the price floor, amplified by the panic of ICO investors seeing the price dropping under their investment price with no clear support until $0.75.Knowing that the ICO price is now at $5+ nearly 100% above the higher price anchor and supported by a tiny little divided minority that hasn't even paid the same price, there is a very strong case to be made that the price of $5+ per coin won't be sustainable and that the market will quickly revert to what is perceived as an already very unfair but still somewhat popularly supported level of $2.63+.Don't ask me how the founders of a project that is heavily reliant on game theory could show themselves this ignorant of even the most elementary notion of game theory and price formation theory. This puzzles me a great deal and makes me wonder if Filecoin will be economically viable. tl;dr: don't buy at $5. The way the ICO was designed has set the higest stable price point $2.63 and the hard price floor at $0.75. Given that $5+ is a 566% immediate profit for presale investors who bought at $0.75 and 100% immediate profit for most ICO investors who bought at $2.63, this creates a significant incentive for investors to sell all the while expecting that their peers will also sell. In a classic case of tragedy of the commons, this will most likely lead to a significant pullback toward $2.63 that is the highest solid equilibrium point for the FIL market."

(team? ICO price?  Github code?)- Fair market valuation, probably. I assume every project will raise it's max. How does the valuation at max compare to other projects' market caps? Industry market caps? And do I think the project can grow with the market or outpace the market.>4)  What mistakes have ICO's made so far that have irritated the shit out of you, and which you think could've made all the difference, if they'd just done it differently?- As a potential investors, I struggled with Gnosis' reverse Dutch auction model. But honestly I think it was better for them as founders, so I can't knock it too hard. Just choose to not participate.On the flip side I'll say one ICO that really struck me as well executed was Iconomi. They left it uncapped, the price scaled with time (not token volume, which we all know triggers FOMO), and it was open to fiat. Now I say it was good that it was uncapped, but that was back in the day when they still only raised something like $12MM. If they ICOed today would it remain that low? Probably not, but at the time I think it was a good move and it worked well."

But what you're effectively doing is offering $2.63 to more people without us paying the actual average. So where does that extra money come from that the terms of the sale promised to raise?

It's not like people are buying farms of servers that each have those pointlessly massive consumer-sized 4TB HDDs.Someone running only computation wouldn't be buying huge amounts of storage space in the first place, or at least trying to keep it as low as possible. They'd have as much as they felt was needed. It also wouldn't make sense to invest in it even if energy usage was minor because it just becomes a waste of capital and time.Businesses spend money on the business they're in. They don't try to squeeze profits out of every possible place because that typically needs capital and/or labor. Why use capital and labor to get into a super low margin business like distributed storage? Amazon margins are due to the sheer economies of scale they're operating at. Those margins and returns on capital go to zero on a small scale.I'm just not sure where people think all this unused storage space is going to come from.

Not everyone does Airbnb but many people do and that increased significantly the inventory of available short term accomodation and forced hotels to be more competitive. In the case of Filecoin, it may not be worth it with a laptop but it's certainly worth it if you have a farm of servers that are doing only computation. Using their unused storage and even adding some more only increases marginally their energy consumption so it's almost free profits once the fixed cost is amortized."

Worst case I earn a couple dollars per month while having someone wasting my bandwidth, slowing down my computer, and killing my battery.Here's an example. Just about everyone with a house has a spare bedroom. Just about every city has hotels. Why don't the majority of people lists their spare rooms on Airbnb? Well, because they don't see it as worth while. I would never in a million years offer a spare bedroom on Airbnb because I don't need that extra small amount of money, I don't need any sort of hassle associated with it, I'd rather have the ability to use it 100% of the time whenever the situation my arise, and I don't want someone possibly using some aspect of my house when I might want to use it.The sharing economy is kinda new, but the vast majority of people don't want to be part of it and have no problem with wasted capacity.When it comes to Filecoin, all it would take is a few minutes of it effecting my internet speed for me to say ""This isn't worth $2/month.""

1398,Successful,filecoin,"Personally, I find it intellectually dishonest that a self-proclaimed ""Community Leader"" and mod for Storj wouldn't first disclose that information before trying to spread around FUD. This post shows how little research you have done into Filecoin, IPFS, and Protocol Labs. >  what are you going to focus on in the Storage industry, what problem are you planning to solve SIA and Storj did not already solve?In a nutshell, IPFS wants to replace HTTP. It already functions as a de-centralized CDN, but there is no incentive in place to guarantee anyone will host/pin your files. Once that incentive layer is built (Filecoin), you have the economic means to support a *truly* de-centralized file storage and distribution system. What problem does Sia or Storj solve? Both of these projects yell ""de-centralized storage!"" from the rafters and that's technically true, because the files are stored in many pieces across many computers. But what's the point? Clearly there isn't a demand for a de-centralized version of Dropbox/Drive based on the utilization of the Sia and Storj networks. Furthermore, if there is only a single point of access to those files, how is that any better than a centralized solution? It is needlessly difficult to share files on Storj (maybe that is part of the design) and it would be a nightmare to use Storj as a de-centralized backend the way you potentially can with IPFS, once Filecoin is built to incentivize pinning files. AFAIK you can't even share files with Sia yet. Storj has the weakest claim on de-centralization out of all the storage tech: if the Storj bridge goes down, so does access to all of the files. Storj Labs also decides the rate charged to end-users, the payout formula, and takes a 40-50% cut of its monthly, non-automated payments to storage providers.

Nothing is stopping people from offering up their storage before the Filecoin network launches.> you have no network, no farmers, how are you going to compete with Storj and SIA?No, it may not have a network yet, but the average sentiment of miners on either of the existing networks is lukewarm at best, once they have had a taste of the payouts and difficulty managing the software (more so Sia's case than Storj). What IPFS has in spades are the developers, check out all of the [awesome](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs) things being built using IPFS as a backend. The more apps built on IPFS, the more Filecoin will be used to pay for file storage and retrieval."

1469,Successful,filecoin,Someone on Angelist/Coinlist said USD tx will confirm pretty much instantly. 
1470,Successful,filecoin,Haha averaging...discounts and vesting...most complicated ICO ever. 
1471,Successful,filecoin,so what is the incentive for some one to bring on storage online if it makes less and less FIL?
1472,Successful,filecoin,"Oh I guess .088544 is before the 20%, so all checks out."
1473,Successful,filecoin,"Quoting my post> On the contrary, it's the price of storage on the network that will become increasingly cheaper, not the price of FIL."
1474,Successful,filecoin,"Yes, it's confirmed. The ""Purchases"" page already shows investors how much FIL they will receive for their investment.It's $2.63/FIL with 6 months of vesting so the OP must have chosen 1 year of vesting."
1475,Successful,filecoin,"With 20% discount ~$2/FIL.Guessing the averaging makes things a bit confusing.. Rate shown for me in ETH is 0.008544 but if I do the math of total ether over # of tokens it is closer to 0.0068360, so who knows."
1476,Successful,filecoin,so supply and demand economics go out the window? If the service starts with a petabyte of storage and then goes to an exabyte the price to storage will be the same?
1477,Successful,filecoin,"I got 2.63 per coin.  Two orders at this, both in the first hour.  No discount."
1478,Successful,filecoin,1st hour average is in. I got in at $2.10 _ôî«
1479,Successful,filecoin,it confirmed. What a crazy 69 minutes. But it's over.
1480,Successful,filecoin,Is this confirmed?? They claimed to have 250 MM in flight during the first hour. 
1481,Successful,filecoin,"Sorry, I don't.I didn't like how this ICO was shaping up so I opted to not invest."
1482,Successful,filecoin,But my understanding is any one can set their computer up so they can sell their unused space (Happens in the background). IPFS allows this with redundancy. That means any one can sell storage. which means massive amount of storage and very low profits for storage providers.
1483,Successful,filecoin,Failed to get transaction details... okay so now what do I do? They ether has left my wallet. 
1484,Successful,filecoin,"Filecoin emission rate doesn't depend on the total amount of storage available, just like the emission rate of Bitcoin doesn't depend on the amount of hashpower available. On the contrary, it's the price of storage on the network that will become increasingly cheaper, not the price of FIL."
1485,Successful,filecoin,Do you know if my eth will get sent back? or the logistics of that? Thanks
1486,Successful,filecoin,One minute past the first hour and the counter was reset to $150 million.
1487,Successful,filecoin,Your order will be rejected.

1492,Successful,filecoin,"Right be there is a limit to the price of real storage, real power use, bandwidth cost. So basically FileCoin will have the side effect of bring profit down of storage ""Sellers"" to almost 0. I.E. There will almost always be more capacity than usage. Any time the price of FileCoin goes up more storage comes online, then prices fall but the hardware is already in place so the storage ""sellers"" barely break even or even loose money based on how much storage they have online. "
1493,Successful,filecoin,"The coin has utility. You will need FIL in order to provide storage as collateral. On top of that you may need FIL for your dapps to pay for hosting. Also keep in mind that the units are divisible, so you may pay 0.0001 for a certain amount of space rathern than always 1 FIL. Add speculation on top and FIL can be worth 100 - 1000 but actual storage costs will only be a fraction of 1 FIL. Similar to the concept of gas. If FIL becomes the incentive layer of the biggest and arguably most important new internet protocol (IPFS) then FIL will be worth in the 100's of billions (total market cap). But that is speculation and depends on the adoption rate of IPFS.I am considering building IPFS apps myself which seems less daunting than writing smart contracts. If only a fraction of users will do that we will quickly have a network that will eclipse anything we have seen"
1494,Successful,filecoin,What? BE CAREFUL! This is probably a scam. No way they'd open this beyond accredited investors in the middle of the sale.

1504,Successful,filecoin,"Yes, but as the price goes down, more people can use the network for storage. If the price is cheap enough, then people will use the network for high filesize content like movies and video game assets."

1526,Successful,filecoin,Good point. I didn't realize that would be lumped into the total shown. So as of this post they have sold about $10 million to ICO investors.
1527,Successful,filecoin,Not exactly. There was $52mm sold in July to advisers. That money is being included in the ICO price calculation so it was shown as the starting number on Coinlist today during the public sale.

1545,Successful,filecoin,"$30 per FIL in year 4 implies a $30bn valuation which is approx. $2bn more than Ethereum is currently worth.  IMO $30 in year 4 would be not a very good outcome.  That is the problem with this sort of valuation at ICO - no offense, but if you think 10x for 5 years in the crypto space is worth the risk, you need to learn more about the space.  There are some little known cryptos called BTC and ETH that probably have a much higher probability of hitting that return over the same time period, plus they are proven, liquid, etc.  An attractive price for FIL is $100 if the ICO price is $2+...  The only snag with that is that it implies a $100,000,000,000 market cap in year 4.  Not out of the question but it is just shy of the total market cap of the entire crypto market at this point.*edited for missing 000s*"
1546,Successful,filecoin,"Exactly! when I as a user go to a website today I'm not paying anything. So decentralized storage would need to be served to users through apps that retrieve the content and then send it to users.

This is not the future of decentralization, but a bad, expensive and slow copy of what we already have."
1547,Successful,filecoin,"> Have in mind that in todays centralized world, users are not paying for content that apps are hosting. FileCoins proposition sounds like 19th century.What are you talking about? If a website or app wants to serve up content to their users, they pay amazon or another host to store the files and for the bandwidth to retrieve them later. Using the Filecoin protocol, websites and apps will still be the ones paying for file storage and retrieval, just to many de-centralized entities instead of a single, centralized one. "
1548,Successful,filecoin,"Hi /u/ubenet , congrats on the ICO. I wish I was able to take part but I still want to send you and the team my best--I believe in the potential for IPFS to transform and protect the internet (I've even tried out the alpha software, so cool!).<encrypted content is hard to see, and while unidentified, miners would likely have deniability (as AWS and every other service provider).This is my primary concern with IPFS / Fc as time moves forward. From the what I've read, the legal implications for a person *unknowingly* hosting shards of illegal files are unclear. I would really like to be able to set-up an early mining node, but I am not willing to risk significant legal liability to do that. I'll say that I actually am glad to see the pre-ICO investors involved for this reason--maybe they can help lobby for more clear legislation with regard to this issue. Do you have any links or sources that you would recommend reading to get a better hold of the current legal precedents for filecoin mining? Thanks in advance. "
1549,Successful,filecoin,I think that filecoin reaching $30 would be a great success and investors would be happy. From a valuation standpoint what would need to happen to value filecoin at a higher valuation than Ethereum is today?
1550,Successful,filecoin,You also pay for bandwidth with many cloud providers.
1551,Successful,filecoin,"Simply put, they envision people putting and getting large files from decentralized network. This is not the future, but the past of holding books in the library and getting and putting books on the shelves when needed. In todays world cloud files are already sharable, accessible in realtime for small fixed cost, even available if needed on servers with cross-connection to your apps. Have in mind that in todays centralized world, users are not paying for content that apps are hosting. FileCoins proposition sounds like 19th century. I'm really sorry to say this, but no one is commenting on their conceptual solution, but everybody is speaking about coin prices."
1552,Successful,filecoin,"I have no idea about the probability of different amounts raised. I didn't claim this was the most likely outcome. However, what is clear is that if you want to invest, you should do so in the first hour. So most money will be raised then. This was different with Tezos where the incentive was to invest in the first 2.5 days (or something like that). My larger point however is different. The structure of this sale allows for outcomes that are in my view super questionable. I'm describing them here. Maybe they'll never happen. Personally, I wouldn't invest in a project that was designed such that extremely unfair outcomes (again, in my personal view) are possible even though they could have been prevented."
1553,Successful,filecoin,They probably saw that people were just complaining on Twitter and Reddit but not many actually pulled funds from CoinList. Remember CoinList is a joint venture between AngelList and Protocol Labs lol
1554,Successful,filecoin,what do you mean?
1555,Successful,filecoin,"I would love to see decentralized storage working, but I don't see that from FileCoins white-paper. Their concept is not providing solid solution for the real decentralized future. Almost like their vision is a big library of books in the times of brith of internet."
1556,Successful,filecoin,Or they'll realize that distributed file storage is less efficient than just buying a few big data centers.  
1557,Successful,filecoin,This math looks correct to me.
1558,Successful,filecoin,"In 6 years we will have Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other cloud companies create even better products/services and no one is talking about that but only calculating coin price. Competition might actually release their own blockchain solutions (and they probably will) from what I can imagine."
1559,Successful,filecoin,"I was initially excited about the deal, but have decided to not participate after all the recent changes. The uncertainty around pricing and the feeling of getting squeezed as an investor just made this no longer appealing. I know of 2 other people that have told me they are dropping out.

1560,Successful,filecoin,How soon will the ico close (if not sold out)? 
1561,Successful,filecoin,Nothing has happened there. They haven Shipped yet! Price increase != value created.
1562,Successful,filecoin,"> The Filecoin ICO sells out in the 1st hour tomorrow raising $660m at a price of $6.This is a ridiculously aggressive assumption. Literally 0 ICOs have raised more than $250MM, the closest comparable is Tezos that raised $232MM, of which $160MM was collected over a **32-hour period**. Also keep in mind that the potential pool of investors for the sale is practically 0.01% of every other ICO. On what basis is it realistic to assume that $660M will be invested in a single hour, when it has literally never happened, nor has any historical scenario even come close?Even raising $250MM in an hour is an aggressive assumption (again, this amount of money has never been raised in such a short period of time), and plugging that into your simple model yields an advisor loss of 60% and investor loss of 89% for scenario 1, and an advisor return of 8.9x and an investor return of 1.5x for scenario 2. If only $150MM is raised in the first hour, keeping all else equal for scenario 2 yields an advisor return of 8.7x and an investor return of 3.1x.You can't just assume that the worst possible outcome has the highest probability and then extrapolate from there."
1563,Successful,filecoin,Gnosis raised 12.5M. FC is raising 500-750M....
1564,Successful,filecoin,"It's almost shocking the amount of hubris displayed by PL and the advisors.   Almost all of the reaction to this sale has been negative, yet their responses are basically ""the advisors add a ton of value"" (a hell of a lot more than the rest of you) and you guys are just moaning about not getting the pre-sale price.   Yes, yes, we all get that polychain has been designated as the advisor shill on the reddit but that doesn't make their laughable arguments any more palatable."
1565,Successful,filecoin,There were similar concerns with Gnosis and look what happened there.  
1566,Successful,filecoin,"There is no mining yet, and very little information out there about it.  If I recall correctly I think there was a post by the devs that mining may still be 6-12 months out."
1567,Successful,filecoin,"I think it's pretty clear at this point that the upside of FOMO/getting in early in this ICO does not outweigh the massive risk/ opportunity cost of having to wait at least 6-12 months for network launch, another 6 months minimum for fully vesting to then only determine if your investment is worth anything more than what you originally paid for. Why not just wait until it hits exchanges and then invest w/ complete information? It's not like the coin is going to hit the exchange and be trading at $20 bucks. Or maybe I'm wrong. "
1568,Successful,filecoin,"I would argue that a $6/token in 6 years doesn't mean ""Filecoin project succeeds pretty big."""

Has anyone seen any potential investor publicly advocating that position?This will probably go smoothly enough for them if first hour demand is not too high. If demand is huge and people end up paying $3+, I'd bet that there will be a big backlash, negative press and potential lawsuits in their future. "
1571,Successful,filecoin,"Yep. I think they are getting bad legal advice tbh. You're very likely to raise a boat load of money, why give someone like me the opportunity to destroy the registration exemption?"
1572,Successful,filecoin,NEO has huge potential but you overpaid. It's being pumped right now because of today's conference. Same exact thing happened at the end of June when they had an event at Microsoft's office in Beijing. Price went from $1 to $14 and then was trading at $5-7 a few weeks later. Look at the charts
1573,Successful,filecoin,What about the 99% of people who are not accredited investors? Would their demand of the coin potentially be greater than the potential sell off? The ICO is for a very select group and the masses could jump all over FIL when it hits the exchange possibly a year or more from now? 
1574,Successful,filecoin,"You mean you didn't believe him when he said this?> Look, we're not doing this to line pockets, we wouldn't be working this hard, nor on these projects -- there's WAY easier ways to make lots of money (in and out of crypto land). "
1575,Successful,filecoin,"My main concern is that currently Filecoin is limited to accredited investors, so arguable only a tiny portion of people are allowed in. You tried to offset this by leaving 70% to mining rewards, which seems a noble approach.That being said you are splitting the invested funds between FF and PL. In all honesty, if FF can't develop everything needed out of its accumulated funds, PL funds won't make a difference. As such, you are free to do with PL funds whatever you want, especially given PL's a private company. It would be a somewhat nobrainer move to try and ""invest"" in your own project via a large enough mining setup. It can be distributed to cover latency too for example by using amazon with an undercut (paid for by the investment proceeds) which would incur zero up-front costs from your side.The net effect of this is even greater centralization since no miner running on their own funds can afford to undercut amazon or provide services with zero upfront cost. As such, I don't see how small people/miners have a chance of turning a profit on their own setups when they are competing with an investor funded entity operating under market costs. Think Uber vs. cab companies, where cabs are going out of business, while Uber is burning investor money to not go bankrupt... it's not a long term setup, they just need to keep long enough afloat to be the last man standing.My fears at this point is that you are asking for humongous investment capital; you are promising a decentralized system to make it fair for everyone; yet you hold all the cards to make PL the next Amazon, sidestepping all the little guys in the process. I'm not saying you will do such a thing, but I'd like to highlight that your incentives (sitting on such a high investment) doesn't necessarily align with the promises you make to your future miners.To be fair, anyone with a large enough investor bankroll could pull a similar move.---All in all I'm concerned that while many decentralized crypto projects of the past have grown organically, you are aiming for an artificially inflated launch that can initially only be held up via centralized guarantees. I'm concerned that whilst IPFS and Filecoin may be the best technologies out there, you are excluding your users at so many levels that there might not be enough interest remaining to allow you to compete with Amazon. Lastly, I'm concerned that PL already went the way of Angel startups, where the true-initial investors are already maximizing their profits at the expense of the tech-blinded ecosystem.I wish you all the best to Filecoin, it will definitely be a crazy ride... but I guess that's what makes it a game changing opportunity. If you'll allow me one advice: take care of your users and they will take care of your ecosystem."
1576,Successful,filecoin,"Interesting you bring up NEO.  Fellow bull here, been long heavy for a few months now, and don't plan on selling anytime soon."
1577,Successful,filecoin,"This is his comment from the other thread which seems to lightly demonstrate his view on ""aggregators"" ""This is a good idea, and we did consider caps and rounds. There are reasons against them too, specifically for a network like Filecoin. Many investors valuable to Filecoin are aggregations of people (eg storage hardware makers, last-mile ISPs, cloud storage investment funds with many LPs (please dont say they're not valuable, they are), etc.). A big investment from a large player like that in the space may be worth a lot to the network long term, and if we had caps we may drive those players away completely -- unless we designed them to be fair to contribution level (scaled to ability to contribute somehow???). That said, we initially did evaluate several different strategies with rounds of players (eg 10K each round, or an increasing amount each round until it sells out). Ultimately this was even more complicated for than the current setup...Reminders:decentralization is not about prevent large players from participating. Decentralization is about removing TRUST in ANY players (large or small), and letting any and all players participate, with fairness (without censorship, according to their contribution, limiting their ability to influence others). Though I do agree with measuring decentralization with Gini coefficients. And I do think massive centralization is a problem along many, many vectors.Do not look at investment as the ""distribution of the token"", as in other networks and ICOs. Mining (specially retrieval mining) may cause much more and further distribution of the token than investments would. Potentially development grants too."""
1578,Successful,filecoin,"Thanks. This is something we've asked Juan about numerous times, without a response. "
1579,Successful,filecoin,How long will the ico last (if not sold out)? 
1580,Successful,filecoin,"There technically can be, but I think it's unlikely just because the market is at a different stage than it was even 6 months ago. The growth it has seen has been insane. To be honest I don't even think it's necessarily greed on behalf of Protocol Labs in regards to their ICO. They really do need to raise a shit ton of money in order to have a chance to build out this protocol that could potentially disrupt Amazon, Google etc. I'm not defending them at all I just understand why they're doing it. If they priced the token at $.10 and only had 10m tokens to sell, they would've been able to raise $1m. That's nowhere near the amount of $ they need. They definitely fucked up with the adviser sale and because of that they can't run a ""normal"" ICO but I guess we'll see tomorrow. There's no rush to invest so I'm just going to watch the price within the 1st hour and make a decision at that point. "
1581,Successful,filecoin,"It now appears very clearly that he is an intellectually dishonest, shady, immature, self-important and arrogant figure. I have a very very bad gut feeling. I am not investing with that kind of gut feeling."
1582,Successful,filecoin,"On Cedric's Vlog, the denominator in your price function was $50M. Why did you reduce it to $40M? How did you come up with this $40M number? Because of all the financial trouble you have put through the community, perhaps you'd consider raising this denominator back up to $50M so the 1st hour investors can invest at a slightly discounted entry point versus previous models. You'd still effectively raise the same amount of money considering you feel the market will act rational on the final price for FC."
1583,Successful,filecoin,"Thanks for the reply Juan, I really appreciate it.It looks like we're just going to disagree here, and that's fine. Ultimately we're all investing in you and the team.That being said, I think there is a flaw in your argument. >Many investors valuable to Filecoin are aggregations of people (eg storage hardware makers, last-mile ISPs, cloud storage investment funds with many LPs (please dont say they're not valuable, they are), etc.). A big investment from a large player like that in the space may be worth a lot to the network long term, and if we had caps we may drive those players away completelyThis seems like exactly the kind of participant you reserved adviser participation for. If there are participants of this nature taking part in the public sale (who were excluded from the adviser sale), why? To be frank, I don't think there's a good answer to this question. Additionally, if the adviser pool is so valuable, shouldn't current investors have the privilege of knowing who these advisers are and what they have/intend to contribute? It all seems quite ad hoc and not nearly enough of a justification for not capping the sale (both to advisers and to the public).  What's done is done, and at this point I'd like to see a quantification of these partnerships going forward."

I am not investing with that kind of gut feeling.This ICO serves mostly as a blueprint to restore VCs monopoly on massive early stage returns. It gives a very bad start to the network and makes it overwhelmingly likely that it will be forked and that the fork will be the more popular network and ends up dominating the ecosystem.That Benet would decide to make easy money immediately rather than making sure that he launches the network in the best possible initial conditions to maximize its chances of success tells long on what kind of person he is and the level of faith he has in the project.

A big investment from a large player like that in the space may be worth a lot to the network long term, and if we had caps we may drive those players away completely -- unless we designed them to be fair to contribution level (scaled to ability to contribute somehow???). That said, we initially did evaluate several different strategies with rounds of players (eg 10K each round, or an increasing amount each round until it sells out). Ultimately this was even more complicated for than the current setup...Reminders: - decentralization is not about prevent large players from participating. Decentralization is about removing TRUST in ANY players (large or small), and letting any and all players participate, with fairness (without censorship, according to their contribution, limiting their ability to influence others). Though I do agree with measuring decentralization with Gini coefficients. And I do think massive centralization is a problem along many, many vectors.- Do not look at investment as the ""distribution of the token"", as in other networks and ICOs. Mining (specially retrieval mining) may cause much more and further distribution of the token than investments would. Potentially development grants too."

On the one side we staunchly support freedom of speech, freedom of information, etc. On the other, we do understand certain communities wanting to self-censor (eg ""bad bits"" posted on this forum would be removed). We think the same answer for IPFS applies here. encrypted content is hard to see, and while unidentified, miners would likely have deniability (as AWS and every other service provider). however centralized and decentralized sets of lists will likely form, that identify bad bits (encrypted or not). possible that individual miners will make their own decisions and take their own risks. (eg miners in france may choose to comply with content taken down for ""right to be forgotten"" questions, but not miners elsewhere, or behind tor, etc).

Ethereum took $18mm in cash and turned it into $20bn of implied value.  That initial entry valuation weighs on a project more heavily than its current value because that's real money.  Ethereum still has high expectations based on the valuation and that's tough to manage but there's some mental breathing room because they already beat the odds and delivered a very cool, unfinished but promising tech to the world and value to all their stakeholders.  Their stress is different than the stress/exhaustion/urgency that someone like EOS will (should?) feel once they get done buying ads in Times Sq and on taxis.I think behavioral biases back this up.

I think this is very straight forward. As it is, we only want investors/buyers who can trust us. That does not mean we are not accountable to all the work we need to do, and accountable to making Filecoin a wildly successful network, but at the same time, placing restriction on the funding is not what we are going to do. There are strong reasons I started Protocol Labs and did not try building IPFS in academia, or at another company. We are working for the long term, if you don't think our intentions and values are true to that, then just don't invest in us. It's really that straightforward to us. We may be asking a lot. We may lose a lot of potential investors/buyers that way. And that's totally fine with us. I would much rather have way less funds and very long-term aligned investors, than lots of money from short-term investors. I've said this elsewhere, we really want people that know us, that understand us, that know our values, and want success for both the Filecoin Network and Protocol Labs.The problem is not my money or my fear about it.  I know when to invest and when not to invest, and honestly, in the grand scheme of things, what happens to my own money is my last concern.  My rank order of importance is: the people whose money I manage's money, my company's money, other random people's money, my money.  I know my own money will sort itself out -- it always seems to.  The problem of the externalities of your raise remains.  So yes, not investing is an easy thing to (not) do.

I may in fact trust you and your team deeply; but your structure relies on it and your argument to me relies on it.  That is a bad place to be when money is involved.  It's a bad think to make normative and it will cost the space as a whole in the long run.Why is it a problem to have all the funds go to the Foundation?  And have the Foundation's mandate to create Filecoin, IPFS, all its dependencies, and anything that is within its realm?  Why are the funds for a FIL token raise going to a for profit entity that by design will have a fiduciary duty NOT to FIL holders but to its own equity investors?  Restrictions don't have to be onerous.  Having none, no charter, no legal or fiduciary duty to those whose cash you've taken other than an MVP by 2022 is not like something one would ever see for a normal security.  None.  It doesn't inspire trust and its design creates the conditions for incentive misalignment and agency issues.  Again, it's a bad precedent.I don't know that [Fred wrote this about Filecoin](http://avc.com/2017/08/greed-isnt-good/), but the timing is auspicious.

The fact that Advisers could start selling tokens just as quickly as investors can is the true issue (regardless if they could sell less of their allocation because their amount will be up at least 4x). If Filecoin raises $200m for an average price of $3 then the float at launch is $200m for the investors and $3/.75 = 4x.... 4 x $52m = 208m for the Advisers float.

1652,Successful,filecoin,"> And I would prefer that people who think FIL cannot pass $30 five years after launch not invest.I am not in crypto investing to spend $2.00 on a token and wait 5 years for it to hit $30.   Hearing you even say that is depressing and reflects that you are not ""of"" this space.  You just want to benefit from the money this space will give you.  This is not the stock market, and you are not here because this space performed like the slow, cumbersome, expensive stock market.   Yet you're bringing that expensive, slow mentality into Crypto, and that is a big reason you are running into such resistence.  Hitting $30 is supposed to be a massive, overwhelming ROI for those who took a risk on your company by participating in the ICO.  A project with 2 billion (freaking) coins should be ICO'ing at $0.05.  And if your jaw drops open or you are thinking I am out of touch right now, then with all due respect, you have not done your homework on this space.The ROI and funding that drew you here in the first place follows a completely different pricing model.  But you're changing it.   You're modeling it after everything non-crypto, and no doubt hoping for the same results.  You say you want the ""market"" to price your token, but you ***start it out*** at $1.35.  That isn't letting the market decide anything.   Nor is the logic that ""making people rush in the first hour"" equates to ""letting the market decide"".  As someone else pointed out, you are putting pricing models together that optimize your chances of making money.   That is all they do.  If you let the ""market"" price this ICO, your tokens would be selling for $0.10 max since you have introduced so much dilution with a 2 Billion coin supply. None of your responses indicate that you care about this, or are even considering making a change.  I will wait until your token hits exchanges, and buy it for $0.50."
1653,Successful,filecoin,"This is what excites me about Filecoin. From a practical standpoint, and with the intention to use it for a very ambitious endeavor that will require Exabytes of data (healid.io), do you have any idea whether and when such scalability would realistically be reached?"

1657,Successful,filecoin,"Hi Juan,Thank you for taking the time to answer questions.  Iäó»m sure that this isnäó»t super fun but we appreciate your effort.I have three questions for you on three different subjects:1.	Does Protocol Labs have a board of directors?  If so, can you share who is on the Board?2.	How do you think about scaling from a transaction throughput perspective in the Filecoin protocol?  The same question phrased differently - thinking long term, I imagine that the chain will need to process millions of transactions a second äóñ how do you think about getting there?3.	Can you explain the origin of the $1 and the $40,000,000 denominator in the Pricing Function?**A couple of comments for your consideration:****Sale Mechanics** äóñ I have shared thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/filecoin/comments/6sc7v7/poll_what_multiplier_do_you_think_insiders_are/dlcd161/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/filecoin/comments/6s87ml/creating_a_win_win_solution/) regarding the current sale mechanics and significant shortcomings that I see.  To address the notion that the current model lets the market set the price - I believe that the price was largely set when 45% of the FIL available in the crowdsale was sold to advisors at an average price of $0.57 per FIL.  Deviating dramatically from that price (beyond a low multiple) appears to create significant discrepancies in the economic interests of parties involved.  Furthermore, how is the market supposed to set the price when market participants have no idea what price they are paying for FIL?  Please consider this from an investor perspective äóñ we are being asked to invest with no knowledge of the price (beyond a six dollar range).  I understand from your perspective the price may not be a huge deal äóñ even at the $6.83 end of the range, you expect significant appreciation if the vision is realized.  It feels incredibly unfair to have to blindly choose to participate at potentially a 9-10x multiple of people who invested two weeks ago.  Please consider a transparent, fixed price for a finite period of time.  I think that the right number is somewhere between $1.00 and $1.30 but understand if you think it is higher.  Even if the price is higher but visible, it is a much more equitable proposition to participate or not.  You have a tremendous tool in coinlist that you may be overlooking: unique registration for each participant (versus crypto wallet registration in other ICOäó»s which can easily be gamed).  To avoid creating race conditions, you could give everyone registered on coinlist an equal allocation of the available coins for the first hour.  At an opening price of $1.30 with max discounts, this results in approximately a $114,000,000 cap for the remaining coins.  I have no idea how many people are registered to participate but a $100,000 allocation per person would suffice for 1,140 participants, $50,000 pp = 2,280 participants, $25,000 pp = 4,560 participants, etc.  If the allocation is extremely low, you can give people another round or two to get a fair bite at the apple.  If everyone has had an opportunity to buy $50-100k worth (or whatever number makes sense given the number of participants that you estimate) for the first hour or other period of time, then go off to the races with the pricing function äóñ at that time people can actually buy based on their appetite (e.g. if someone wants to accumulate a $1m position with only $114M total available, it should come at a price).  This also achieves a goal that I think has been missing from the current sale äóñ I believe that you generally want to encourage as wide of participation as possible. This type of structure would be much more fair than the current structure.Thank you for taking the time to address questions and concerns from the community.  I like to think that we are about to embark on a very long journey chasing some audacious goals.  Please take your time to get this sale right so that we can move forward in alignment."
1658,Successful,filecoin,Lol or you can save the money for further Coinlist projects.
1659,Successful,filecoin,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but if $150MM ($200MM total) comes in the first hour, isn't the price $5 (assuming no discount)?  In this space, that can happen with a small number of participants. edit:  I am incorrect.  Refer to the price function [on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBJApmWDhS9cEdI0weoYuUWHpe4g94Es3z2f8lUOf4U/edit#gid=1681113432), which lowers the price."
1660,Successful,filecoin,"Sadly, I just don't see any way the risk/reward pays off for anyone after the lucky 150 investors.  Assuming $200MM raised in the first hour (this includes the $50MM already raised), the price will be $5.  If you opt for no discount your break-even looks to be around $1.5B in marketcap assuming you sell in six months.  There seems to no incentive to actually hold because the accelerated distribution to miners pushes up break-even even if you take the discount.   Please someone check my numbers."
1661,Successful,filecoin,Thank you very much for taking the time to respond so thoroughly!
1662,Successful,filecoin,"> 1) Will the ICO go forward on Thursday? If so, will it remain the same structure even though you changed the goal posts at the 11th hour financially impacting the community (transaction/wire fees + opportunity cost) or are you thinking through improvements to the existing structure?As of now, we have not changed the structure. We would like to improve it (and believe me, we have had many thoughts). but we are actually pretty stuck here. We already changed things a bit (in what we thought was a fully beneficial way for everyone, including USD-only pre-funders) and it caused serious frustrations for many -- even from people who this benefitted most (bitcoin funders). ANY change whatsoever (and even no change) has many people to frustrate and make angry. There is -- unfortunately -- no ""best way forward"", no ""the right way"", every path out is painful. No matter what we choose, some group of people will be frustrated and angry. We have to make the best of it.I know we disagree, but we (who think filecoin can be worth significantly more in the future) think this pricing structure is actually good. Perhaps not as great as it could be, but we do not think it is fundamentally bad. (And lots of investors agree at least that it is good enough to invest in.)I will definitely agree that there are bugs with it, and that a different one could serve us all better. This is really horribly late though. I'm  disappointed in myself for having gotten us here: we are stuck in a situation where improvements could be made, but ANY change would cause serious pushback and would frustrate people even more. (the strongest feedback we've gotten is: ""do not make any more changes!"") So, it's either we do it, or we don't. If we stop the sale altogether, then we have to postpone it for months in the future. And in that case, likely just into a proper ICO around network launch. This stuff takes a ton of time. It's taken us months to get here.2) Can you share the other views / mediums who you think have reasonable contrasting opinions (hopefully objective)? Clearly your advisor group who has participated in the pre-sale would like the ICO to move forward in this structure.- Lots of people prefer the average. Lots of people were very relieved when we switched to this. Not because of crypto, but because it removes massive risk, and because the expected value is better. We'll make an illustration that captures this.- Lots of poeple prefer the previous structure before the average (despite it being strictly worse for almost (if not) everyone, even pre-funded USD...).- Lots of people think -- like us -- that Filecoin can be worth significantly more in the future. Potentially several orders of magnitude more. Of course, this is a massively risky endeavor, but if we manage to succeed greatly, it is possible FIL could be worth >$10, >$30, >$100 etc in many years. This gives significant return potential. Yes, everyone always would like a lower price, but many people are excited to participate as it is. If you are not, please do not invest. I cannot stress this enough: we would ask that if you significantly doubt FIL could be worth >$30 in 5 years after network launch, please DO NOT invest, at all.- Lots of people think we should do other things: a flat uncapped sale, a dutch auction, a flat capped sale, to proceed as is just add stop limits...- Some people think we should cancel this sale and just do a proper ICO on network launch (inc to unaccredited investors, as the token would be live then).- Don't assume everyone in the advisor group would like the sale to move forward as it is. There is diversity of opinion everywhere. We have gotten thoughts (from our advisor group, from outside, from people uninvolved, and from prospective investors now) pointing in many different (and conflicting) directions.- We are also getting many ""hang in there"", """" you guys are doing great work"", and ""haters gonna hate"". also, one ""fuck the naysayers... you guys are doing it right."" (all of these from non advisors)> 3) As part of the investor allocation, can you please explain the justification of selling 45% of the allotted FC to your collective ""advisor"" group for $52M (over a 3 year vested period) while the remaining 55% of the allotted FC will be projected to be sold for 10-12x to the accredited investor public?(I've said some of this before)The advisor sale involved an amazing group of technologists, researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, industry leaders, and investors. All of these people and organizations: either (a) have been working hard with us for years to make IPFS and Filecoin successful, (b) have fully committed themselves to work hard with us and for the Filecoin Network for many years to come, and/or (c) offer tremendously valuable advice, hands-on help, knowledge, skills, resources, connections, and more. We have already worked with most of the people and firms involved äóî most of them for the last 3 years, as advisors or investors to Protocol Labs, to IPFS, and to our team. We welcomed many NEW people and firms that showed significant promise and who have made very strong commitments for the long term. We managed to get some partners pivotal to anybody in the cloud storage industry.We will put all our advisors to work for the Filecoin Network. And I am not kidding when I say that the group we assembled in our advisor sale is likely to be one of the most capable group that have ever funded any project. (I say this with full understanding of the breath of projects and the magnitude of support many tech projects have gotten.) And all of our advisors are committed -- vested -- to work closely with us to make the Filecoin Network as valuable as they can, for years to come.I can try to say something to the delta in price here. First, it is NOT projected to be sold for 10-12x. If we raise 100M the average price is $1.86-$2.32, and then it's 2.5x-4.4x. If we raise 200M the average price is $2.50-$3.16, and then it's 3x-6x. yes, it goes up from there.I do not understand why so many people here simultaneously think that (a) this sale is not a good deal, and that (b) it will sell out. One of those should give, no? How can those two positions be held simultaneously so firmly? If you don't agree it is a good deal, then do not invest, at all, please. If you are right, then many others will agree and also not invest. We would raise less, we would not sell out. If you do invest, then you negate that position to some degree.The biggest issue here is that with the average structure, people can be pulled up by a lot of capital coming in all at the same time. This can be frustrating, and exacerbates the difference from advisor sale to public sale... it's unfortunate, we are thinking about it. It would feel much, much less disparate without averages, and some people getting the lowest price.The second thing to say is that lots of the people in the advisor sale have already contributed a tremendous amount, more than the median investor coming into the public sale will likely contribute (beyond money). I think most people on r/filecoin are severely discounting the work of people who have helped us bring Filecoin into being, for years. And, to be direct and honest, it is likely the case that the median old and the median new people in the advisor sale will likely add more value through their direct hands on work than the median public sale investor (it's likely that the median public sale investors will be passive speculators -- maybe not the people here in r/filecoin, but definitely likely for the whole sale). I'm not trying to sell anyone short here, I know that tons of people coming into this public sale will be amazingly valuable contributors to the network. Of course, we expect many people in the public sale to contribute much, much more.If it helps, for the first hour, plan is to show in the UX what the average price is so far (paid txns, w/o in-flight txns), so some can choose to wait and see for a few minutes, and decide not to invest if the avg price goes too high. The commited investors likely want to invest as early as they can (to try to price out others), but participants preferring the option to opt out could wait to see how much accumulates before investing.Also, people are saying ""this is not a good way to distribute the token"", well please remember that we DO NOT intend the investor sale to be ""the way to distribute FIL"". Our main distribution will come from mining! ETH prioritized miners much less (for good reason, it's going to be a PoStake network). For Filecoin, miners and clients are the main people in the network. Distribution through mining. We are very confident we'll have a nice distribution, by year 2, miners overtake investors, and overtake PL+FF. By year 4, miners overtake investors+PL+FF. See See: https://protocol.github.io/filecoin-econ-graphs -- Maybe don't invest-- maybe go for HDDs instead. Or nothing at all. Please, if you have reservations and dislike this sale, then please do not invest. IDK. "
1663,Successful,filecoin,"/u/jbenetJuan, I am a huge fan of IPFS/Filecoin and of you personally. In the blink of an eye this crowdfunding will be over and you will leave behind an indelible legacy that can't ever be changed.The community believes that the clever and thoughtful fundraising structure you've designed favors price maximization over fairness, whether you and your current advisors believe it to be true or not.So here is your true test - are you willing to set aside all the hard work and thought that has gone into the design of your raise to give the community (one that Filecoin needs to thrive) the sense of fairness it desires?The public thinks mainly about price, particularly about the price of the advisor round. Given the quick timing from that round to the public funding, what is a fair discount to give them?For an industry level precedent setting event like this the other large question is custody of the funds and the separation of a Filecoin foundation and Protocol Labs. I trust you, but you are setting a standard that allows other projects to have full discretion over what funds go to the project and what funds are used for other corporate purposes. Do you want even partial responsibility over potential issues that your precedent will engender?That's all, the rest is up to you. I know you will make the right decision, for now and for your legacy. "
1664,Successful,filecoin,I agree. Too much money too soon distorts ones thinking.
1665,Successful,filecoin,"Not a false argument; 3-year vesting for non-advisors only offers a 20% discount instead of 30% for the advisors, so one can't assume that everyone will opt for the 3-year again. In addition, the likelihood of non-advisors opting for the 3-year vest doesn't negate the fact that there's still an option for non-advisors to have all their tokens while advisors are waiting for 80% of theirs, because it's already known that almost all advisors went for the maximum vesting period.That being said, I hope everyone opts for maximum vesting as it has implications on investors' long-term views of Filecoin/IPFS as well as keeping the final price/coin of the sale as low as possible."
1666,Successful,filecoin,Yes. This is the biggest concern... it is some unknown really high multiple of the advisor round only a few weeks ago.
1667,Successful,filecoin,"> It's not harder to write a secure DAO contract than it is to write any other secure contract and currently in Ethereum there are plenty of contracts handling significant amounts of money. Just look at the ENS name service contract, the EOS crowdsale contract, the Bancor contracts, the Maker contracts etc. Beside the original DAO contract has been fixed and reaudited so it wouldn't be much work to deploy it. And with all the attention and expert eye balls it has benefited from, it is now arguably one of the safest smart contracts ever written.It is not an argument as much as it is a note or observation to temper expectations to something closer to reality. The Parity multi-sig wallet was supposedly secure, went through multiple security audits, the code was open source and everyone could see it. A bug was committed to that smart contract on March 7th and left untouched until someone decided to use it 2.5 weeks ago to steal over $30M (that hacker could have easily taken more before anyone noticed). Gavin Wood coded that smart contract and he is one of the co-creators of Solidity, so it is not safe to assume that even experts can create perfectly bug-free code easily. You are greatly trivializing the difficulty of the language.> Like this is going to stop anyone... Do you own any token issued in an ICO that was open to non-accredited investors such as, for instance, Ethereum? Are you registered with the SEC?No to both. Even if I had, the SEC is not applying the ruling retro-actively.In addition, I find it amusingly hypocritical that only seven hours after accusing me of ""straw-manning"" (incorrectly, I might add), you respond with four straw-man arguments of your own!> It's a fallacy caused by the same bias that makes people think that planes are a dangerous mode of transportation after hearing the news of a plane crash all the while ignoring the far greater risk of driving a car.We are talking about the difficulty in creating bug-free code. I did not say that smart contracts cannot be trusted at all because they have been exploited in the past.> Just look at the ENS name service contract, the EOS crowdsale contract, the Bancor contracts, the Maker contracts etc. Beside the original DAO contract has been fixed and reaudited so it wouldn't be much work to deploy it.Just because there were ""safe"" contracts in the past has no bearing on the overall difficulty on writing a new smart contract. My interpretation of your OP was that the DAO you describe would replace the ""Filechain Foundation""; wouldn't that require much more development than copying any of the mentioned crowdsale contracts? Such a foundation should be incentivizing developers to push code to the protocol, as the Filecoin Foundation will do. Has such a contract ever been written?> Let's be practical here. The SEC is never going to be going after small investors and if they do the entire US crypto community is going to jail.I am only explaining that a risk exists. I wish to be compliant with regulations to minimize my liability and others feel the same. Whether or not you and others choose to has no bearing on the fact that those regulations exist going forward.> Beside the SEC doesn't have jurisdiction over non-US non-accredited investors of which there are plenty who would have loved to invest in Filecoin and were not allowed to for no good reason at all so even if US non-accredited investors are all suddenly having qualms that they may infringing on some obscure regulation they never heard about, there is still plenty of capital to go even without them.Okay, but your OP states including all excluded investors, and non-accredited US investors are a subset of that selection. As of now, there are pretty strict rules WRT selling securities to that subset, hence the inspiration for my comment."
1668,Successful,filecoin,"> You're a great, smart guy and I've been following this project and you for awhile. I've been honestly flummoxed by the last month. Thank you for the previous attention and support, and thank you -- very sincerely -- for your post here. I'm sorry you have been flummoxed (great word!).> If you don't want to face scrutiny, then don't raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the public. It's that simple. And certainly do not raise money for Protocol Labs, a separate for profit entity, by way of a fundraise for Filecoin. This is a fundamental problem in this structure that creates a can of worms worth of issues for investors.Yes, this is a very important one to address. We are selling these SAFTs to finance Protocol Labs, the Filecoin Foundation, to build Filecoin, its entire ecosystem, and fund future work. For example, we will continue funding IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, and other underlying technologies, all of which are absolutely KEY to Filecoin. There's a whole stack here. More, we have to fund some cryptography and systems work (we need more good libraries, some new ones). Separately, we may invest significantly into the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, as we will be using lots of that tech (and we need to improve some of it). For example, we'd really like formally verified contracts (there's great recent work on this, but implementations not yet there). We need to have the freedom to invest in these and other ancilliary projects that are valuable to Filecoin. Also, worth noting that Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment lab -- much of the work that will benefit Filecoin for years to come may come out of seemingly unrelated work. Note also that Protocol Labs' reward is to be able to do and fund more, different work.I think the safe thing to do is this: If you DO NOT trust Protocol Labs is sufficintly incentivized (with having created the network in the first place, caring about it in the same way we care about IPFS and other projects, our token ownership level, and the 6 year vest that externalizes long commitment) then please DO NOT invest. I think this is very straight forward. As it is, we only want investors/buyers who can trust us. That does not mean we are not accountable to all the work we need to do, and accountable to making Filecoin a wildly successful network, but at the same time, placing restriction on the funding is not what we are going to do. There are strong reasons I started Protocol Labs and did not try building IPFS in academia, or at another company. We are working for the long term, if you don't think our intentions and values are true to that, then just don't invest in us. It's really that straightforward to us. We may be asking a lot. We may lose a lot of potential investors/buyers that way. And that's totally fine with us. I would much rather have way less funds and very long-term aligned investors, than lots of money from short-term investors. I've said this elsewhere, we really want people that know us, that understand us, that know our values, and want success for both the Filecoin Network and Protocol Labs.I want to remind you here of this podcast, which you may have listened to. https://blog.ycombinator.com/ipfs-coinlist-and-the-filecoin-ico-with-juan-benet-and-dalton-caldwell/ -- there is a lot of work that we think is really critical to do, and much of it will dramatically improve the Filecoin Network, even if an audit or report wouldn't immediately see that. Look, we're not doing this to line pockets, we wouldn't be working this hard, nor on these projects -- there's WAY easier ways to make lots of money (in and out of crypto land). We see great opportunity here to create an organization capable of fundamental work, and Filecoin is our business model, which will fund much more valuable work. If you're uncomfortable with this at all, please just do not participate.> I put together my thoughts as questions when you asked for them in your blast yesterday.

1669,Successful,filecoin,"(Disclaimer: this post contains forward-looking statements, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.)Hey /u/eeksskeeThank you so much for your excellent post! I will try my best to answer all your questions, as directly as I can.> Now please, bear in mind that you are asking for hundreds of millions of dollars. Consider that when you write things like:> > There are also a ton of insults and false accusations thrown our way, which don't really make us want to answer things here. It (honestly) drives us away, which then causes more things to go unanswered. I ask that you keep things civil. Definitely be direct, ask what you need to ask, but please be respectful. I will not answer questions from people who aren't.> Telling people that you don't want to or won't answer questions when people ask tough questions is a really hard thing to hear or believe in this context. It's the opposite thing I would want to hear from any CEO, any project head or any leader in any situation. I think you misunderstood me-- i did not say i do not want tough or ""really hard things to hear"" -- no, what I ask for is some level of respect in conversation. You have so eloquently shown it along with great questions, and hence I am responding to you first.> That's incredibly frustrating, not only because it suggests there is something to hide but because leaders, teams, and projects BENEFIT from thoughtful criticism. Use it, don't sweep it under a rug.You're totally right, and I -- of course -- agree! Thoughtful criticism is key to the success of any endeavor of any group of people.I hope it is clear by now that I'm a strict adherent to scientific principles, which includes vigorous debate and criticism of any and all ideas, no matter who says them and without holding anything sacred.What I was objecting to insulting posts that can be found throughout this sub. I think lots of people in the crypto community are used to this vitriol but it's not pleasant, it's not useful, it's offensive, and I don't have to pretend it's not there. I like speaking with and engaging with thoughtful and respectful people, and I will prioritize them. Sure, no question I will have to engage with people who aren't, i do it all the time. But sometimes I can be selective.> It's not supposed to be easy to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. Money comes with strings, both before you get it and once it's in your hands. It's supposed to be hard and should be hard. This fundraise is likely to be bigger than the median IPO raise. Think about that! You know friends who have IPOed and think about what their companies had gone through to get to that stage, the struggle, the scrutiny, the battery of lawyers and investment bankers, and hedge fund analysts wearing vests while interrogating the principals with questions read off their iPads. This is a cakewalk in comparison. On the other side of an IPO, companies find themselves answerable to the market every quarter. Given the valuation you're seeking and the amount of dollars you will raise, you should expect even more scrutiny from a bigger public on an ongoing basis, expecting you to deliver on a several billion dollar valuation for a project in a space that may not work at all and has no revenue nor proven source of value creation. That is a monumental challenge with already monumental expectations. You need to be ready to deal with it.You're right-- and I am ready for it. My lack of responses so far has been a time issue: going into these last two weeks I utterly underestimated how much time I needed to devote to this. I had a full workload of other things related to the offering, and got stuck unable to drop critical things to participate in the public discourse. That was a mistake in my own time management, and I'm sorry for it. I am here now, and with time to discuss.You are also right that these crypto networks are raising formidable amounts of money with different reporting standards. We would like to set great examples with both Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Network in general. Of course once the network is live you will be able to trace all transactions there, but there is much we can do between now and then. We plan to do pretty frequent reporting, both of progress and status. There are certain constraints we'll have (eg going public properly is an onerous process, as you've described, and most tech companies wait much longer for it). We are not prepared yet to sign ourselves up for that level of reporting, but we do want to set a good example here and do some level of reporting for those participating in this offering.> When you do things that don't make sense or fly in the face of convention (and subsequently are revealed to have massive holes in them, some of them obvious), you shouldn't get defensive or blame other people for making your life difficult. This ICO has not gone smoothly and you have faced further scrutiny because of your choices and decisions, not because people have been unfair (or uncivil).I do not mean to blame others, I merely request a level of proper discourse. Many examples or analyses so far have been way off, yet are proclaimed as fact and evidence of our wrong-doing. It is our own fault for not providing way more tooling, models, and spreadsheets for people to evaluate everything. But i also think it is fair to say posts could have been more inquisitive, still direct and harsh, without shouting bloody murder from mountain tops on wrong conclusions. For example, Stefano's post was deeply frustrating because it was that: way off, needlessly incendiary, and he didn't bother to check it with us. (eg no way our offering allows for 1.3B! even in the extreme case of both selling out completely AND no discounts, etc.)> Your actions effect not just your investors, but the entire space, given your prominent position you have earned by being awesome and doing the work. Own your choices and make the appropriate fixes. It looks to me you have been given a lot of bad advice by people close to you or people who have inserted themselves into the process with other motives. But I don't know, I can only judge by watching the series of questionable financial design choices and questionable organizational design choices that you have rolled out and scratch my head and wonder whether we're all just recreating the 1999 dot com bubble.Thanks for the feedback. I do internalize it, and believe me this offering has given us SO many learning experiences.I don't agree our decisions have been so terrible, but I also know they haven't been nearly as good as we wanted them to be. (Eg the bug with 100M+ racing in) It is also the case that we see them from completely different angles, and are optimizing differently. For example, a big goal with the pricing function was to allow the market to price the token, and price the market out. Everyone instantly assumed the max was our target raise, which was not our goal. People are mad at the maximum price, but to be very, very clear: we do not expect to raise the maximum. I do not think the market is so irrational people will pay any price; i think it will stop at a certain price. I would really like it if all the people who invest think FIL can be worth way, way more in the future. And I would prefer that people who think FIL cannot pass $30 five years after launch not invest. That's just not a bet people will feel good about.Anyway, I think the biggest issue here is lacking of communication, about why we choose X or Y, etc. This is worth mentioning: we've found ourselves with our hands tied behind our backs much more than we are used to. I am used to complete transparent conversation on github issues, where everything is ripped apart and everyone can lay things bare, where people can argue and point out flaws. Going into this, we found ourselves much more restrained, with lots of legal warnings about how to engage, what to say or not say, and what our supporters can say. One example is we don't feel very comfortable posting our models of how we value the token, or what we think it will be worth, because that may be setting totally undue expectations that people would then be super upset about. We are very restricted in the claims we can make, and therefore we are restricted in the models we can give. Maybe we are being too conservative, maybe not.We are charting a lot of new territory here -- doing a token sale, with this brand new SAFT, using 506(c), in the US, ... Legal opinions differ on how involved people can be on the discourse, what we can assert and claim, what forward-looking info we can give, what others (supporters, advisors, other investors) can say. That -- coupled by being overwhelmed in time -- yielded a larger vacuum of conversation that we're used to. No excuses-- we should've prepared much better here -- just noting this has been part of it.(continued in next post)"

Assuming that Filecoin is able to undercut that price slightly, let's say $21/TB/month, it would require that the data is copied onto 3 separate hard drives to have any guarantee that the data wouldn't be lost. So the mining cost of $21 would be split between the three miners that are simultaneously storing the data. This would give each miner revenue of $7/month for renting out their TB of data. Right now the cost of a 1TB hard drive is around $100, so the miner wouldn't be able to even make a return on their hardware for more than a year. That plus the computational cost of calculating the Proof of SpaceTime. Should a 1-year+ ROI be expected for miners or am I missing something else (such as Filecoin anticipating a large drop in the cost of consumer data storage)?2/ What is Filecoin's approach to content takedown requests?

I know because I follow him, and I'm also a limited partner in his special opportunities VC fund launched on angel.co a couple years ago.  He made 1 investment in that fund and returned the rest of the capital only a few months after it launched, due to his hiatus decision.It's beyond obvious that his friends (I suspect Naval and Kevin Rose were big influencers -- I also would be willing to bet Kevin got in on this advisor round without any real ""advising"") told him the potential of Filecoin and offered him a spot.  Looking at his tweet, he clearly does not have even a minor stake of his overall focus on the project.  I'm sure when he found out how it was structured, he knew it was a low risk way to have huge upside, he even hints at liquidating after holding 1 year.  We don't know for sure if he actually followed through and invested, we just know that there is an extremely high probability he was offered a spot, and contemplated buying for a flip in 1 years time.https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/888096502777860096?lang=enI like these people, and I don't hold any animosity towards them for being in the advisor round.  But to say this is fair and the status quo is ridiculous.  At the minimum limit the amount each advisor can purchase at the discounted rate, if they want more then they can participate in the main round like everyone else.  Filecoin actually did the opposite of this, if you look at the original price over sale volume chart, the anticipated allocation for advisors was oversold, and they started taking from what was supposed to be the start of the real sale."
1681,Successful,filecoin,">While an interesting idea, it is a lot harder than people think to write a bug-free smart contract to make a DAO. I expected that argument. It's a fallacy caused by the same bias that makes people think that planes are a dangerous mode of transportation after hearing the news of a plane crash all the while ignoring the far greater risk of driving a car.It's not harder to write a secure DAO contract than it is to write any other secure contract and currently in Ethereum there are plenty of contracts handling significant amounts of money. Just look at the ENS name service contract, the EOS crowdsale contract, the Bancor contracts, the Maker contracts etc. Beside the original DAO contract has been fixed and reaudited so it wouldn't be much work to deploy it. And with all the attention and expert eye balls it has benefited from, it is now arguably one of the safest smart contracts ever written.> In addition, it pushes the ""sale of securities"" liability onto the investor (meaning investors would need to register with the SEC in order to sell hypothetical Filechain tokens).Like this is going to stop anyone... Do you own any token issued in an ICO that was open to non-accredited investors such as, for instance, Ethereum? Are you registered with the SEC?Let's be practical here. The SEC is never going to be going after small investors and if they do the entire US crypto community is going to jail. Beside the SEC doesn't have jurisdiction over non-US non-accredited investors of which there are plenty who would have loved to invest in Filecoin and were not allowed to for no good reason at all so even if US non-accredited investors are all suddenly having qualms that they may infringing on some obscure regulation they never heard about, there is still plenty of capital to go even without them.

1690,Successful,filecoin,"Mr. Zurrer - I respect and appreciate what you do and what you guys have been able to achieve.  I do not share the sentiment with the OP and think this discourse is a bit unfair, however I do see the roots of this issue:While I agree with you that many (if not all) projects have special allocations, discounts and even free tokens for advisors (and early contributors), almost all that I've seen create different allocations for advisors and for the general token sale.  **By mixing the two in a common pool, it creates the perception of a zero-sum game where advisors are benefiting at the expense of the general investors.**  Most advisor allocations that I see are typically a much smaller fraction of the general sale allocation - sometimes 1:9, 1:5 or on the extreme 1:3 (for every one token sold or given to advisors, three are sold to the general public).  In this case the ratio is very close to 1:1 (9:11 to be exact).  This appears to be way out of line with other ICOs.  Based on data that Protocol Labs released in the last two days, the average price of this sale was $0.57 per FIL.  As investors, we see that nearly half of the ICO allocation was sold to ""advisors"" at price of $0.57 per FIL.  **We are then told that we will have to invest with zero visibility on the price, that it will be somewhere between $1.30 and $6.83 but we will not know until after we've handed over our money.**  This is the source of much of the frustration.  It creates an automatic 4-9x return for the advisors, who just put their money in within the last couple of weeks (hard to argue that this capital has faced risk commensurate with this return, especially given the discount and transparency on price).  It also creates perverse economic incentives where nearly half the ICO participants have a cost basis of around $0.57 while half will likely have a basis in excess of $2.00 - 4.00.  While I understand that the advisors are all ""long term stake holders"" and achieved $0.57 by generally vesting for 3 years, we know that this was not a ""friends and family"" round.  Nearly every sophisticated crypto investment group and many big SV players participated.  There appears to be a huge gap in the alignment of interests between the advisors and general participants in the current model.  Taking into account the vesting time frame for the advisors, what is stopping some advisors (which include some of the savviest investors and traders in the crypto space) from selling at the first sign of adversity / bearishness post-launch in an attempt to influence the price and increase their holdings at a lower price, perhaps at the expense of the general crowdsale participants?  While this may sound outlandish, this type of shenanigans is not unheard of, especially when all parties are acting in their economic best interest.  I believe that this is the root of much angst surrounding this crowdsale.  You do not need to answer this, and this is largely a rhetorical question but: would Polychain participate in the general crowdsale given these conditions, with very little visibility on the price of your investment?  If you invested $1,000,000, you could end up with somewhere between 769k FIL and 147k FIL (no discounts included) but you wouldnäó»t know until after you invested (compared to the same investment yielding 1,754K FIL in the advisor sale with the discount).I also recognize that everyone who doesnäó»t like the terms doesnäó»t need to participate.  I am hoping that through a positive dialogue we can reach a structure that looks and feels more fair for all participants.*edited for grammar*"

1696,Successful,filecoin,"WRT to #3, I think it would be more accurate to phrase it as 6x-8.5x, even though 10-12x is technically possible.Filecoin would need to raise between $400M and $750MM (dependent on the average level of discount/vest) in 1 hour to accomplish a 10-12x as you stated. /u/Whyrusleeping provided some [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBJApmWDhS9cEdI0weoYuUWHpe4g94Es3z2f8lUOf4U/edit#gid=1681113432) to showcase that. Furthermore, with the old model, this would imply an ending price of $10-$18.70, or 20-37x.Another thing to keep in mind is that advisors appear to be locked for a year at minimum, and most opted to be locked in for 3 years.

If creators actually want this type of distribution, I don't understand why more ICOs don't use this mechanic. I don't think the Filecoin sale makes much sense to participate in anymore.

Personally, I feel differently on some points, but we will have to agree to disagree.

Why is dynamic pricing needed and why can't you just divide the tokens equally among investors prorata of their investment like all other uncapped ICOs have been doing?You mentioned that the dynamic pricing was needed to encourage people to ""derisk"" the investment by investing first, hereby making it less risky for subsequent investors. But this argument doesn't hold examination. First $52M have already been invested by advisors in the presale which is more than enough to cover costs until launch and way beyond. Further investment won't change the risk. It's already entirely clear that if the project fails it won't fail due to lack of funding.Second none of the materials covering the investment process, including screenshots of all the UI screens, indicate that their will be a counter allowing investors to evaluate the amount of capital already contributed and the amount of capital inflight.

Juan has confirmed this as well, in terms of pre-funded USD, but has also acknowledged in other comments that USD will be far, far worse than anything once the sale has started. However, I have not seen any statements, from Juan or anyone else from Protocol Labs, that you should sell BTC/ETH for USD to pre-fund your wallet, only that USD confirmation is fastest, then ETH/ZEC, then BTC.

1762,Successful,filecoin,"First, thanks for being willing to answer questions.  It's appreciated.Now please, bear in mind that you are asking for hundreds of millions of dollars.

It (honestly) drives us away, which then causes more things to go unanswered. I ask that you keep things civil. Definitely be direct, ask what you need to ask, but please be respectful. I will not answer questions from people who aren't.Telling people that you don't want to or won't answer questions when people ask tough questions is a really hard thing to hear or believe in this context.  It's the opposite thing I would want to hear from any CEO, any project head or any leader in any situation.  That's incredibly frustrating, not only because it suggests there is something to hide but because leaders, teams, and projects BENEFIT from thoughtful criticism.  Use it, don't sweep it under a rug.It's not supposed to be easy to raise hundreds of millions of dollars.  Money comes with strings, both before you get it and once it's in your hands.  It's supposed to be hard and should be hard.  This fundraise is likely to be bigger than the median IPO raise.  Think about that!  You know friends who have IPOed and think about what their companies had gone through to get to that stage, the struggle, the scrutiny, the battery of lawyers and investment bankers, and hedge fund analysts wearing vests while interrogating the principals with questions read off their iPads.  This is a cakewalk in comparison.  On the other side of an IPO, companies find themselves answerable to the market every quarter.  Given the valuation you're seeking and the amount of dollars you will raise, you should expect even more scrutiny from a bigger public on an ongoing basis, expecting you to deliver on a several billion dollar valuation for a project in a space that may not work at all and has no revenue nor proven source of value creation.  That is a monumental challenge with already monumental expectations.  You need to be ready to deal with it.When you do things that don't make sense or fly in the face of convention (and subsequently are revealed to have massive holes in them, some of them obvious), you shouldn't get defensive or blame other people for making your life difficult.  This ICO has not gone smoothly and you have faced further scrutiny because of your choices and decisions, not because people have been unfair (or uncivil). Your actions effect not just your investors, but the entire space, given your prominent position you have earned by being awesome and doing the work.  Own your choices and make the appropriate fixes.  It looks to me you have been given a lot of bad advice by people close to you or people who have inserted themselves into the process with other motives.  But I don't know, I can only judge by watching the series of questionable financial design choices and questionable organizational design choices that you have rolled out and scratch my head and wonder whether we're all just recreating the 1999 dot com bubble.You're a great, smart guy and I've been following this project and you for awhile.  I've been honestly flummoxed by the last month.  If you don't want to face scrutiny, then don't raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the public.  It's that simple.  And certainly do not raise money for Protocol Labs, a separate for profit entity, by way of a fundraise for Filecoin.  This is a fundamental problem in this structure that creates a can of worms worth of issues for investors.I put together my thoughts as questions when you asked for them in your blast yesterday.

Only to then, hours before the ICO, change the guidelines completely, rendering the act of cashing out the TSLA completely useless **(but really let's be honest, it was BTC cashed out, the new 1 hour average means the act of cashing out our BTC to pre-fund our Angel account as we were instructed to do for the best possible ICO price was absolutely pointless and only resulted in the loss of substantial funds)**In the beginning I refered to Filecoin as the possible ""cause"", which I think the evidence proves to be correct.

Other than the warm, fuzzy feeling knowing that you're giving back to the community and not being a dirty leecher, there is not much incentive to providing the service. This is why torrents have to be re-uploaded all the time, users rely on benevolent seeders and eventually those seeders will move on to something else. That's the whole point of Filecoin, incentivizing those seeders/hosts to ""pin"" IPFS files so that they are always retrievable.If this is something you're interested in, I would definitely check out the [IPFS repo](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs)"

End users don't pay for storage/data, it's the producers and distributors of data that pay for that and they are the ones who demand the highest level of service because their businesses actually depend on it.The trend is that the vast majority of typical consumer data is in the form of photos and videos, mainly on smartphones. Data creation beyond those is very, very small. Given the device integration, you'll have a hell of time getting people to switch from ever growing free cloud storage on iCloud and Google to an IPFS that has no integration and costs money.I also think you overestimate how much storage people need. I have 256GB on my laptop and only 80GB in use. It's a pretty high-end laptop. I have about 1TB of RAW imagines and video data on back-up external drives that I never really need. It's back-up, not constantly accessed data. I've long since gotten my edited JPG and stored them for free on Instagram or Facebook (though I do pay for Flickr because I like it).Who exactly are all these consumers with large storage and retrieval needs aside from smartphone users sharing pictures/videos? And like I said, that stuff is usually free and integrated. In many cases people go on to upload that stuff to other free places anyway, like FB, Instagram, etc.I know tons of tech people, I know tons of ""regular"" people like my mom and sister in law. They have almost zero storage needs. I don't know anyone who pays for cloud storage.No one I've ever known outside of enterprise has 16TB of storage. I've never had anywhere near that amount in my entire life. And if I did, I would never want it in the cloud because that is too slow to actually access when I'd want it. All that data would no doubt already reside on the or near the machine I intend to use it with. If I want to store it to show/watch later, I'll just upload it for free to YouTube or something and it will get streamed to me at various levels of compression best suited for my connection.Most cloud revenue is enterprise and enterprise is not a use-case for IPFS. People with vasts amounts of data are better served by companies like Amazon or their own internal networks.I'd also point out that if an IPFS makes so much sense, why pay to use it? Why wouldn't people adopt it for free like Bittorrent? If everyone finds a need for the IPFS and it grows considerably, why wouldn't people just collectively support the ecosystem that they get so much use out of? Bittorrent accounts for, supposedly, 3% of all Internet traffic. That is in fact an absolute shitload of traffic. If a ""free"" protocol and network can achieve that, why couldn't another ""free"" network achieve that.I see a use case for Filecoin and the IPFS, but I don't see a business model.

1822,Successful,filecoin,"> even though $2,5 dollar is expensiveFWIW, if you've been in this space longer than a year, you'd know that $2.50 is outrageous considering a 2 Billion total coin supply.  The math just does not work out in anyone's favor except theirs, which is probably why the word ""greed"" keeps coming into play.  Again, Ethereum - the paradigm changing technology that is going to transform finance (therefore, the King of the hill) had 100 million total tokens and that was considered way too high at the time.  But at least they had the sense to offer an ICO price of $0.30.   Understand:  The Filecoin total supply is 20x higher than Ethereum's was.  Yet their ICO price is nearly 5x higher.  This is literally the opposite of what should be happening. Over time, a vibe for what is ""reasonable"" when it comes to Total Coin Supply + ICO Price has developed in people's minds based on how various ICO's have played out.   If you've been through this process 30 times like I have, you know ahead of time when that ratio is not advantageous to the investor. The simple fact is that the more coins you have, the more downward pressure will be placed on the token value over time, purely as a result of having too much supply.  That's why if you start out with an ICO price of $0.06, it doesn't have to go very high to keep investors happy.  People don't end up waiting 5+ years praying the company becomes wildly successful just because they got a horrible ICO price and won't make decent returns until Filecoin hits $50.00 USD.   Many of the new token ICO's are breaking this rule of proper ratio.  Nearly all of them are offering total coin supplies in the Billions and paying no regard for lowering the token price.  Again, this is where greed is coming into play, and creates a stark contrast with crypto projects of the past that actually wanted a fair deal for everyone.  This is honestly like the constantly repeating ""story of humanity"".  Something starts out pure, and good, with great deals and amazing returns both for the teams and investors.  Then human greed takes over.  Desensitization begins as prices rise slowly.  2 years later, the very concept of a 100m ICO at $0.30 is a fantasy scenario that is long gone.  Now everyone's got 5 Billion coins and $5.00 ICO prices.Voila, its the fucking stock market again.   Years/decades of waiting for shit returns.  Massive risk of zero returns because the ""company"" has to reach epic levels of success for your investment to have any meaning.  And the longer you're forced to wait?  The greater chance of company failure.  No thank you.The pre-sale investors who managed to get a 30% discount honestly didn't even get a good deal compared to past projects.  Even their $0.56 is still far too high for a 2-Billion-coin system.  Several times I've heard the explanation:  ""The days of making lots of money in crypto are over"".Why?  Because a new crop of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are flooding the space and don't care about anything but getting rich AF?  Giving everyone a bad deal instead of a good deal?  That's not a good enough reason for me.  Nobody said this project had to have 2 Billion coins.  As an example of a team that is trying to do this the fair way:  Po.et  (https://po.et) has a 3 Billion coin supply.  But they had the awareness (honesty?  integrity?) to lower the ICO price to $0.06.  The crowdsale starts at 8am this morning EST.  This ratio falls perfectly in line with successful ICO's of the past, and they are going to have a lot of motivated investors pouring money in as a result."

1860,Successful,filecoin,"This is a valid point, but the proposed (and tweaked last minute) filecoin ICO parameters are not the solution.  By your logic we should skip any and all presales and have ICOs be more like an IPO and launch on one or more liquid exchanges open to the public-- which is a valid option IMO.  The original intent of presales was to fund the product launch, it's clearly grown beyond this in the last 6 month or so crypto bull run, and maybe the model is broken.Look at how a launch such as CVC was successful.  The tokens were distributed across 10,000 unique users.  Personally, I got stuck in the back of the queue and was only able to buy a fraction of what I had hoped for.  Nonetheless, objectively, this is a fair model.My most pressing issue with the filecoin ICO is the unknown price element after the purchase is confirmed.  You say the simple fixed price first-come model will create a mad buying spree, give the lucky all the value, and you need to let the market determine the price.  With the changes made last night, you are not solving the problem.  Now there is a mad FOMO fueled rush, and nobody knows what price they are even paying, how is that letting the market determine the value?  The value would have been determined via a combination of FOMO + the price increase function set by protocol labs, there is nothing free market based about it.The fact remains we are buying tokens for a network that might not even launch in a years time.  We are entitled to some upside.  Protocol labs is going to make out with millions regardless of success or failure, after this ico.  Given the time and risk involved, absolutely value should be ascribed to the ICO investors.  And if speed/luck is a large factor, I'm sure the losers/unlucky would appreciate that they didn't end up paying an insane multiple on tokens that have a heightened risk of trading for a fraction of what they paid in 6-18 months when they hit exchanges.  Better to miss out than take a fat loss and leave no one the chance for profit."

That was the reason for the lunatic scheme of dynamic pricing, if 55% has to fund 100% you need to make the token price unknown, there is no way around that. If you make it public before the investors chip in, then, the moment it gets 3x relative to the Listers, no one is going to buy, so, it doesn't really matter whatever the scheme you come up with, you have to make that price invisible to the investors. I really hope Iäó»m mistaken but I see no way that they come up with a flat rate in the first hour as it is suggested on another post, because the problem is then shifted to the next trench, someone has to put the money, and if the funding is displaced to the later stages of the sale,  when it is already evident the price is  6x, no more money is going to come in. There is no way already rich inverstors are going to pay 6x in any ICO, no matter how promising and interesting it is to 45% of Listers. You could have reserved only 10% of the mass for your Listers and get them their risk free 10x, but they got too greedy and sucked up 45% there is no way they get 10x on 55% of the mass. The sane thing to do would be to refund the Listers  their sum and start all over, or reserve 10% more or less for the real advisers (if you really have any of those, I highly doubt it though, for sure nothing technical, maybe some of the same old tired recycled Valley mentoring bullshit).

Cedric forced their hands with the video. So, now that this has been postponed to 08/10/17, how are we supposed to trust that another token sale is not taking place right now (as I type the comment)?

He is getting sucked in, by salesmanship.4: raking in say, 500 USD million is obscene and not required. FileCoin if it is any good should mostly self funding. Many cryptos are given away to achieve buy-in. Stellar gave away 16 Billion as I recall... and they have real software, and understand the SEC risks.5: I am beginning to think that, they have delayed the ICO launch twice now, because they do not have the buy-in that they felt they could grab. Hence, waiting until the software comes out may be the best way forward.6: Lastly, and unlike Bitcoin, running a FileCoin node is going to be just for the large data centers.

They would much rather utilize a distributed storage network.  Howeveräó_They may also want to use those 16 TB hard drives to plug into a storage network that incentives them to rent out their unused disk space and storage capacity. Now they are no longer just storing their information on their own hard drivesäó_They are storing it on a network, and being paid to allow others to borrow the previously used storage, while still being able to store everything they want to, or had previously. They still have the option to store privately anything they want on their own, without subjecting it to the whole network or one company. Much smaller chance that information gets hacked and shared. E.g. Extreme example... The Hollywood celebrity hacks of iCloud accounts that then get shared to the world. They need the cloud storage because they are storing so much less useful or personal information on their phone (no distributed network yet) they then regulate it all to one company, not a network. Not sure if this answers your question thoroughly, hope it does.

1907,Successful,filecoin,"That's not disinformation, that's an easy to understand fact.

1909,Successful,filecoin,"You wouldn't. But at least you wouldn't get disadvantaged by investing at a different point. One could also add an element that Ethereum did:Let the price flat for 1 week and afterward you increase the price by 2% per day. This way you can either invest in the beginning if you don't care. Or you wait until the end of week 1 and invest then, so you'll have some idea how much else was invested. Or if you want more certainty, you wait until day 8. Then you pay 2% more, but you should have a very precise idea of the total invested. There won't be a mad rush and there won't be pointlessly giving some people a better rate. The Ethereum crowdsale was well structured from an incentive perspective. They should just copy that or do something similar."
1910,Successful,filecoin,"I definitely wont disagree with this. It was frustrating to read twitter posts about how ICO information was ""coming soon"" or ""a couple weeks away"". Then suddenly an ICO launch date was announced, much sooner than most expected, while all the important investor documentation was missing.

1911,Successful,filecoin,"I was working on the assumption that a majority of funds, including my own, were going to be submitted as fiat.

And that's where this is all so frustrating. I'm certainly happy that the manufactured rush has been removed, which is an improvement. But the ICO still has some concerning flaws.The uncertainty of price until after one invests, coupled with the steep price increase, just seems unnecessarily risky. Particularly considering how much money is involved. Advisors were given a flat rate, which alone undermines the arguments made by PL for the steep price increase and game-theory based structure."

1914,Successful,filecoin,"Three days seems ridiculous. It's not nearly enough time to go through the changes made and actually ensure that there won't be any more last minute changes, while also making the ICO seem much less credible. The process is already so complicated as it is. : /"
1915,Successful,filecoin,"Siacoin, Storj, etc are un-optiumal storage systems...Sia uses Proof of Work (PoW) whereas Filecoin uses Proof of Storage (Spacetime) (PoS), something Protocol labs invented. Because Sia uses PoW, there are manufacturers starting to produce application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware to make for more efficient/profitable mining. This choice includes a couple side effects and negative consequences in a distributed network model. PoW models incentivizes miners to amass hashing power - which is basically performing meaningless computations and consuming large amount of energy unnecessarily. PoS by contrast incentivizes miners to invest in additional storage (where the investment belongs in the context of a distributed storage network) rather than in ASIC's, which really don't create any additional value for the network.PoS make far more sense in this context than PoW. ASIC's equipment is very expensive and this price's average people out of the market. However, storage is far cheaper - thus, it's easier and cheaper for new participants to join the PoS network model. Since the cost of storage is cheaper, itäó»s logical to think the demand will be higher. Siacoin forces users to buy expensive, exclusive and, sophisticated hardware as the backbone of the network. Filecoin is going to allow users with only a personal computer to participate as a miner in the network äóî much of which can be done with already available/unused disk space. This makes entrance into the marketplace free in a lot cases.Itäó»s pretty difficult to state how important distributed storage is to a distributed web model.This is what anyone who buys Filecoin when it goes public is betting on. That Proof of Storage is better for a storage system, than Proof of Work. "

There is also one protocol under development that is very close to Filecoin in design and actually exceeds it significantly in scope and ambition: Maidsafe.Although it's hard to evaluate the size of the market, a comparative analysis can be done based on the market caps of the other project.Siacoin has a market cap of 273M and a long term inflation rate of 2%.StorJ has a current market cap of 26M and a total market cap of 157M.Maidsafe has a current market cap of 160M and a total market cap of 1.6B.The largest ICOs to date has been  Tezos with 250M. If Filecoin does as well as Tezos and we ignore the dynamic price mechanism setup by the Filecoin founders to artificially pump the price and decide instead that the starting market cap would be the amount of capital raised, Filecoin would roughly fall in line with Siacoin for its current market cap based on 10% of the total supply, and would roughly align in total supply with Maidsafe with a total valuation of 2.5B fully diluted.This means that if Filecoin performs as well as Sia and Maidsafe in the long run, it will not be a very profitable investment but not a huge loss either at it would be expected to hover around the same valuation.Buying filecoin at ICO price equivs to buying Maidsafe or Sia at current market price.

2007,Successful,filecoin,"What do you think I am?What do you think I do for a living?  :/Why do you think I asked that question?  Maybe because it certainly is not something that was clear to most accredited investors I know who had signed up for a Filecoin ICO and not a Protocol Labs ICO.When did that doc come out?  Within the last 7 days.  When did they change the terms again?  12 hours ago. I've never seen anything like this pricing structure in regular markets.  Nothing.  I also can't recall a funding this asymmetric (Filecoin investors get Filecoin upside, Protocol Labs gets all the money, 50% more Filecoin than Filecoin investors, don't have to deliver anything but an MVP, have upside to all the other investments they make or can just dividend themselves the cash) for anything despite having seen a lot of shady schemes in regular markets. That this is all part of trying to LEGITIMIZE the ICO market is embarassing.  The precedents being set here are bad.  But this will make normative bad structures, bad pricing mechanisms, bad incentive alignment, and open a can of future worms.This may or may not be legally compliant.  It's absolutely not compliant with the spirit of the securities laws or the spirit of the SEC's mandate or the spirit of Filecoin circa 1 year ago."
2008,Successful,filecoin,"I'm honestly not even sure there is any consumer demand for Filecoin at all, whether the protocol is finished or not.Who is the average user of Filecoin?

2009,Successful,filecoin,"Yeah I got pretty fucked. Pre-funded my coinlist.co wallet with a lot of USD, mostly from selling other crypto. Was looking forward to buying ASAP when the ICO started. Now it doesn't matter whatsoever, I can go get a coffee and wait 45min after the ICO starts, then buy in and I will get the same price as everyone else, how sad.I'm really disappointed, not because I'll be losing a lot of money from this 1hr average weirdness (which I will), but because I was super excited about this project and team and now feel like they couldn't actually care less about someone like me investing. "
2010,Successful,filecoin,"It's because without a finished protocol to establish the level of redudancy and encryption overhead you can't do an exact analysis..But even with an inexact analysis you can see there are going to have be some pretty big leaps to compete with the modularisation of the big boys, particularly as any solution can be more securely and rapidly deployed by those large providers with existing spare capacity to more efficiently (potentially) utilize their servers while undercutting filecoin both by speed and security.Storage costs are a hygiene point for enterprise and not really a pain point for consumers."
2011,Successful,filecoin,"Understand the frustration. To their credit though, they listened and removed the most dangerous element of the original ICO plan -- the intense rush to invest first. It's true we wont know the averaged cost until after investing. But the same was also true with the original approach, and possibly worse. A misclick, browser issue, DDoS attack, etc could have delayed your submission a split second longer than other fiat funders, and you'd be stuck with a far higher price than the new averaged price approach.At least now people will have time to read the fine print, and make certain they're sending funds safely.I think you're right to be frustrated. Changes this close to the launch date could have been avoided if ICO details were simply shared more in advance. Why not have a month lead time? But I do think the Protocol Lab team was right to consider the dangers of a rushed investing round. If moving the date of the ICO isn't possible, then I prefer this updated approach over the riskier former structure."

2016,Successful,filecoin,You mean public investors pay $450-$700M for 110mm tokens...
2017,Successful,filecoin,"It's been several hours since my first post on this update, I've had time to reflect on these changes.  Honestly, my initial frustrations have grown into full out anger.  90+ mm sold to the ""advisors"" at .75 BUT most actually only paid **$.52** because most opted for the 30% discount.  Now we are expected to gamble and pay up to 12x times that price!How can anyone from the filecoin team even say with a straight face they are trying to make things more fair.  A fixed or tiered model would be fair, it's quite simple.  Yet the team acts like someone has forced this pricing model on them.  This is pure greed.  I'm sure investors would even be happy with a $1.50 start price, that's almost 3x the advisor discounted price.  3x in a couple weeks.  But, no, protocol labs cannot even extend us a 30% discount for vesting our shares, at a multiple of the advisor price, we only get max of 20%.  Again, to try to argue protocol labs attempted a fair structure, is laughable.Is it even legal to do what they are doing for this 1 hour average price calculation?  ...Advisors pay $50mm for 90mm tokens, investors pay 200mm+ for remaining 110mm tokens.  The way this is structured, and the FOMO that is likely to occur on an extremely small supply, I will be surprised if we can't buy filecoin far cheaper on the exchanges a year from now (maybe not advisor price, but if this ico structure scams some people into paying $10+).  To me it looks like a recipe for a class action lawsuit.Unless something changes, I've decided I'm out.  "
2018,Successful,filecoin,"This is fucking rediculous. I am no longer investing, and I'd advise everyone else to stay away too. If someone from Protocol Labs is here reading, here's some feedback:1. Don't make 11th hour changes on people that can seriously effect the economics. I understand if you felt like changes were necessary, but if so, push the sale back by a week or something to give investors the time to think these changes through (and for investors to again explain to you how badly you are fucking this up so you can hopefully change it again...). You are changing the terms terribly, and many inexperienced investors are going to get screwed without even realizing it because now they are rushing to invest within the first hour and literally just got this new information. 2. I'm not investing in something where my price is unknown and between $1 and $6 (a 6x differential!!), out of principle, and would strongly urge everyone to skip this sale for this reason. I think these increasing price ICOs are generally distasteful, but I can live with it if the price is always clear and steps up in a staggered manner. This is just crazy and disrespectful of your supporters.If I were you, I'd postpone the sale, and strongly consider a new model where each day has a clear price that steps up the following day.  You are letting greed drive your decisions, and it's going to cause your investors (I.e. those who should be your biggest supporters) to resent you and their investment right out of the gate. "
2019,Successful,filecoin,Precisely. 
2020,Successful,filecoin,I'm out. 
2021,Successful,filecoin,"It is more than my strategy that I feel bad about. My main issue is that I don't know how many FCs will I be getting. It could be anywhere between 11k or 2.5k as I mentioned above and the difference is substantial :(Also, the last minute changes are concerning. What was the need for doing this at this hour? The sale economics document had been published almost a week back. Everyone had equal time to figure out the best strategy for them. Now, suddenly things have changed. All the planning which I did including selling off my BTCs, moving funds etc. have gone waste. I feel I am being taken for granted in this entire episode as you have assumed that no matter what you do, people like me who are your ardent supporters will invest. And that is very disappointing.Let me illustrate how I am feeling with an extreme example (and I am NOT suggesting that there was anything wrong with the advisor sale). Let us say you made this deal to Sam Altman (one of the advisors who was offered a pre-deal) in that you offered him FCs for some amount of money but you tell him that the terms he is getting may or may not be sweeter than what the general public gets. Further, right at the last moment, after he had funded his Angelist account, you tell him, hey Sam, btw, the deal which we gave you last week has completely changed. Here is the new deal where you now don't even know how many FCs you are going to get (except there is an upper bound) and you have 14hrs to figure out what to do. How do you think he will feel?"
2022,Successful,filecoin,"You ""feel bad"" that this put the strategy at a disadvantage? How about you guys reimburse people that liquidated their BTC holdings to pre-fund their wallet. How about you reimburse those wire transfer fees while you're at it as well? The fact that you guys didn't think through any of this beforehand is mind boggling. And yes, I'm pissed off. Even if I don't invest, I still lost literally thousands upon thousands of dollars by liquidating my BTC because..

That is one small benefit of waiting.   But its a bad deal no matter what we do at this point.Technically he's also right about the slim chance that everyone avoids the 1st hour and the price at the beginning of the 2nd hour would therefore be lower.   2nd hour picks up where 1st hour leaves off (If I am understanding correctly).They should have just added fixed prices based on earlier investing windows.  Simple.  Done."

Nobody is going to pay this much for filecoin from the general public.  Not at the beginning.  And all the ICO investors are left bag holding."
2027,Successful,filecoin,"So you guys offered the ""advisors"" a fixed price of $.75 and the ability to recieve a 30% discount if they chose 3 year vesting, but the rest of the community (the actual insane amount of money needed to make this project potentially work) gets a blended price average of the 1st hour raised and only a 20% discount if we choose 3 year vesting. How exactly does that make sense?It's pretty messed up what you guys are doing to the investors that will actually fund the $100s of millions needed for you guys to even have a slight chance of disrupting S3... Honestly you guys should really consider pushing the ICO and having a fixed price, at least for the investors who are willing to jump in right away. You want us all to feel good about the investment and the project, not to invest because we don't want to miss out!*** If you take the average level of vesting, you guys would need to raise ~$580m within the 1st hour to sell out.

2028,Successful,filecoin,"Thanks for this. Follow-up question related to one of Juan's answers to One Block Chain capital:""Original Q: How do the Chinese pre-ICO collections on Renrenico and Lhang fit in with the timed sale process (they claim to be Filecoinäó»s partners on the sale) äóñ they have raised >20k ETH combined. Will they just dumped on Coinlist as the sale opens? How are they getting away with the accreditation process?Juan's answer: These collections ARE NOT AT ALL connected with us, and they HAVE NOT gotten any permission from us to do what they are doing (reselling). Some of them say they have negotiated a deal with us to be proxies (resellers); this is completely false! Investors should invest directly through CoinList and note that anyone who claims to have permission from us to be a Filecoin reseller or ""proxy purchaser"" is lying.""These Chinese collection agencies have now collected over 100,000 ETH to invest within the first hour of the ICO (looks like they take a 2% fee for consolidating). I assume this is against your terms of service.

The randomness in latencies here meant that despite your best efforts at clicking through as fast as possible (and very likely not reading all those checkboxes youre clicking) you really dont have any control over the price you get there. Plus as someone else pointed out, If someone were to try and DoS angellist, it might delay the USD payment confirmations even past the ethereum ones."
2042,Successful,filecoin,"Can't agree enough. Either halt this ICO all together or stick with the original plan. /u/Whyrusleeping your supporters cashed out crypto at a monetary & opportunity cost, and now you are moving the goal posts.

In fact, this is a WORSE SOLUTION as you are providing SEVERELY LESS FAVORABLE terms for investors who PREPARED for this ICO based on YOUR DIRECTION. This is such FUCKING bullshit. "
2043,Successful,filecoin,"So since the price function is in terms of amount raised, and our input is amount raised, we've got some interesting math to do. Most people doing the computation just did an iterative approach, which is pretty close, but the actual function you want to use is:```FILRecvd = $40m * log( (raised_so_far + purchase_amount) / raised_so_far) )```To apply the discounts here, you scale the purchase_amount in the above by the discount like so:```disc_price = price / (1-discount)```So now that we have that, the 1rst hour price bucketing:We collect all the investments that will be in the bucket then take the total USD equivalent value of all those investments (with discounts properly applied to scale up each individual investment). Using that amount, we call the above function to get how much filecoin that group purchase is worth, and then divide each investments value up from that. Essentially taking the average purchase price and applying it to each tx in that set.Beyond that, your second question, since so many people in the advisor sale chose 30%, we sold 90.4M filecoin, The great part of that is that it means pretty much all of those investors are in it for three years. We did out all the math for a few different scenarios in a spreadsheet, going to post that in a little bit after sanity checking everything.(sorry that took so long, been up a while)"
2044,Successful,filecoin,"The sad part is, they are probably going to end up raising MORE money. The new model really incentivizes as many investors to put in cash in the first hour at a completely blind price. This is morally dishonest. "

Earlier, if I made the payment within 5min (via ETH using very high gas fees) or cash, I had a decently good idea of how many FCs I was getting. Now, everything is a blackbox. If I make a $15k investment, I may get 11k FCs or 2.5k FCs. The difference is startling and there is no way I'll know how many FCs I am getting since it depends on how much investment you are getting in the first hour and I don't control that (vs. before when I controlled how quickly I can make the payment). 2. Also, why change things at the last moment. I sold by BTCs last week (and it appreciated considerably since) to get cash to fill in my Angelist wallet.

2075,Successful,filecoin,"Personally, I pre-funded with USD because I evaluated the alternatives and noted that USD pre-funded investors would have a giant time advantage. I don't appreciate them changing the rules every 3 or 4 days. They need to have people who have actually structured IPOs consult with them next time. The ICOs organizers don't have their heads in this game."
2076,Successful,filecoin,"This is ridiculous.  IMO this is worse than having it the way it was supposed to go down originally.It's almost as if Protocol labs is trying to game/take advantage of all the price conscious buyers.  Buyers who would only be buying in if they knew they could get in at or below their personal price target.  Now all of those buyers are forced to take a gamble in the first hour, having no idea what the price will be, other than it being $6 max... Which gives advisors & friends 6x+ instant returns.  A lot of these ""advisors"" didn't even know or care about filecoin until their well connected friend said ""hey, you need to check out this great project, I can get you in on the advisor sale"".  Here is a perfect example of what I suspect is one of those situations playing out:  https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/888096502777860096?lang=enAll of us regular investors/supporters who have been waiting months to join the filecoin movement will have to pay a multiple on these ""advisors"" cost.For those of you who saw the Cedric Dahl advisor sale video (before it was taken down) it looked like the buy price was shown and confirmed before final confirmation of sale.  I realize that it could be different for the main sale.  However, having seen this, I took the time to make sure my account was pre-funded with fiat.  I'm confident others likely did the same.  I knew that if I used fiat, I would be able to buy at or very near the displayed FIL price before closing out the order.  This allowed me to manage my risk in an ICO where the price could skyrocket into obscene valuations.  Even at $1, filecoin is valuing itself at $2 billion.  This is a massive valuation for a seed investment, and puts the investor in a questionable risk/reward situation.  Paying a large multiple of that nearly cripples the risk/reward opportunity IMO.I can understand that some advisors provided great value to the project, and they should be rewarded.  However, having all these last minute tag-alongs is just not right.  Each advisor should have been given a fixed allocation based on their contributions.  They could even have tiers to make it easier, and so they do not have to make a custom list for every person.  If an advisor wanted larger exposure than his/her allocation, they could buy into the regular sale like everyone else.All this complaining, and I'm an accredited investor... I can only imagine how frustrated someone who cannot even participate on coinlist is.  As for tomorrow, I'm now unsure what I will do.  **If the filecoin team truly wanted to make things right, they would have the opening price locked in for the entire first hour.**  This mystery buy-in under $6, will likely work for them due to FOMO, but honestly it looks a lot like they are taking advantage of the situation."

Now I lack confidence the terms won't change again tomorrow due to network congestion or other unforeseen circumstances. Also, now I have to delete my account again and go back to trying never to comment about anything. I only came out of my hole on this one because I thought it was different and I found that exciting.   "

2081,Successful,filecoin,"thats nonsense, i think you may have misunderstood it. you will be paying more per FIL (filecoin token) if you waited to buy in the second hour as the price function would resume as normal i.e. amount raised / 40mil, i.e. if they raised 100mil in first hour then the first hour participants cost is 152/40 = $3.8, participants in second hour will be paying more than this as it will increment as initially intended. does that make sense?"

This structure isn't going to help you discover the true price of FIL, since we (public sale investors) won't even know the price that we will end up paying.

2181,Successful,filecoin,"A similar question was asked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6oa6mx/announcing_the_filecoin_token_sale/dkfuv5f/). I responded at the very end of the chain before realizing I don't have enough karma to post. TL;DR: IPFS is more de-centralized than Storj and has a lot more developer support. here is the copied (hidden) comment:> I was curious about this myself and dove in, here's a rough summation if you don't want to traverse the post as well as the Storj documentation. Full disclosure, I have not used the software myself, so take this with a grain of salt. > > Storj, as an open-source project, is de-centralized in theory, but pretty centralized in its current implementation. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/storj/comments/6dffhw/statement_regarding_storj_and_decentralization/dj5ptmj/) is a good read from the thread. To add to that comment, there are other key factors that make Storj more ""centralized"" than something like IPFS and it essentially boils down to the economics: the storage/bandwidth pricing for users is set by Storj Labs (the company), the payout formula/rate to Storj nodes is also set by Storj Labs [as shown here](https://gist.github.com/super3/a36a3d4967951ec678200f499364b81a), and it also looks like Storj Labs handles all of the monthly payouts internally. In contrast, the plan for Filecoin/IPFS is to create separate marketplaces for storage and retrieval, essentially letting the free market decide the best rate and directly connecting consumers to providers through smart contracts. To be fair, Storj has an active team and announced intentions to integrate smart contracts and micropayments (real-time payments instead of monthly) into the platform, which would help address some of the above points, so it will be interesting to see how these products evolve over the next year."

2219,Successful,bancor,"The CRR they have is up to the token creator and how they want to distribute their investment. If the creator wants to hold, say, 50% of his investment in GNT, 30% in BNT, and 20% in ETH, then those would be the CRRs.The reason for having two different types is that they will be used differently. Token baskets are for investing and will primarily be bought and sold but not used to exchange reserve currencies. Token changers are to bring liquidity to non-smart-tokens will primarily be used to buy and sell their reserve currencies. "

2224,Successful,bancor,Wrong link. 
2225,Successful,bancor,Any ideas why they are delaying?
2226,Successful,bancor,"Hey /u/bitcoinlogo,So the answer is that they don't. They can have a CRR of <100%, and the remainder would serve as a fee that's taken from each trade through the changer/basket.However they can't have a CRR greater than 100% because that would mean that the total worth of the token's reserves is greater than the worth of the token. That simply wouldn't make sense for the creator or users, as they're effectively locking up more worth than they're creating.You can have a token changer with more than two tokens. In fact, that's more or less what a token basket is. The only difference is how they're meant to be used. Token changers are primarily for conversion and token baskets are primarily for investing, but you could use token changers for investing and baskets for converting if you have a good reason to.  "

Also, I would expect that stakeholders who are aware of all these upcoming partnerships would be investing in BNT and raise the price.  Insiders who think it is undervalued should be buying.Finally, the timing of all these reserves is unclear.  Stox, KickICO, etc. - we don't know when (or if) they will be setup and frankly, who wants to use BNT as a reserve when it is declining in value.On the other-hand as the Op notes, we are a loyal community of supporters who believe in the vision.

2381,Successful,bancor,"i used the Mist/Ethereum wallet on my Mac, and every time it updates I lose my transaction history. "
2382,Successful,bancor,"Thanks for the reply.Basically it will be a token that will hold other utility tokens such as Storj, Sia, etc. The idea is that by holding our token you can use Storj seamlessly without needing to purchase storj tokens because our contract will do the conversion for you with its internal supply of it.I am still trying to wrap my head around what happens when the tokens diverge in value. So for instance say our tokens are backed by some ratio of storj, or have some supply that's say 1:100. What happens when say our token doubles in value compared to storj?"
2383,Successful,bancor,"Good point. Small currencies aren't the only use case, just (arguably) the most potentially impactful. I compare it to youtube enabling the explosion of small-viewership videos, which makes up the lion's share of their total video views.Token baskets are also a major use case from the investor's side of things, of course.Token changer's main advantage is that they can replace currency exchanges. They can also bring liquidity to long tail non-smart-tokens. But the advantage for bigger currencies there isn't nearly as large as the advantage for long tail currencies via smart token liquidity. Yeah, Bancor will be going non-ERC20 in the future. But that's likely a year or two down the line, and likely to piggyback something like Polkadot. "
2384,Successful,bancor,"Interesting take. Do you think Bancor can succeed if small currencies are the only use case? From the whitepaper, I gathered that token changers (especially for larger currencies) and token baskets were the greater use case (or at least equal) vs the long-tail small currencies. 0x (and related services to be built on top) seems to have nearly closed the door on the larger ERC20 currencies at this point.Neo would not work now, but as I understand it, Bancor plans to eventually work with non-ERC20 as well, including Bitcoin, NEO, etc. If the ERC20 market is lost, that might be a good move depending on how expensive the technology is to develop."
2385,Successful,bancor,"Small currencies is the main use case. Large currencies still benefit from the lack of fees & volatility resistance.Also NEO won't work on Bancor either in the near future as Bancor is also ERC20."

2387,Successful,bancor,"Yep. Wouldn't have invested as much in Bancor as I did without reading it at least twice. Two things (companies, protocols, etc) don't need to overlap 100% to be competitors.

2396,Successful,bancor,"Hmm, small currencies like ETH and GNT? Yes, well aware of the idea of long-tail currencies. I think it will be very interesting to see how that plays out and it is possible Bancor can stand on that alone. But there is zero doubt that they were also gunning for the larger currencies as well. To date they have mentioned GNT and NEO and a few others I believe - all large enough to have plenty of liquidity via 0x. (Neo of course isn't ERC20 so won't work with 0x). So, I stand by this being a competitor to Bancor. "
2397,Successful,bancor,"Still not really. See Bancor works as an exchange for currencies that would never get large enough to be listed on exchanges like this. The long-tail of currencies, like a currency for a farm, or a local meetup community, or a small village. With 0x, these currencies still wouldn't be in enough demand to be liquid. With Bancor, they'd be liquid no matter the size or demand."
2398,Successful,bancor,"I was using scale loosely here.

2415,Successful,bancor,"I'm not Eyal, but I am on the team. Here's my thoughts:1) BNT is an ERC20 token, so any wallet that holds ETH can hold BNT. For example, I hold my BNT in a Ledger Nano S, which is about as secure as you can be.2) Stuff like this is on the to-do list. However its pretty far down the line as it involves KYC and a lot of other stuff, and is already being done by existing exchanges. As for being 10x better at doing this, I don't see how that's possible. The functionality is pretty simple (fiat to crypto conversions), and its being done well by a number of exchanges.3) Yup, this is what we're currently working on. "
2416,Successful,bancor,"Well there's Kraken, which was pretty main."
2417,Successful,bancor,"I believe yes to the first, though I don't know for sure as it depends on the functionality you're trying to build in. If you want a better answer, email your idea to contact@bancor.network with more details.If you deploy as a normal ERC20, you won't have the ability to make your token into a smart token later. Your best bet in that case would be to create a token changer that holds your tokens and BNT, which would then connect your smart token to the network."
2418,Successful,bancor,"An aside. I am anxious for for the day when we find there's been a hard wired security bug in one of the hardware wallets (or even say Apple's Secure enclave).

2432,Successful,bancor,Did you figure it out?
2433,Successful,bancor,"Hey /u/coinberries, a few edits/adds:1) Bancor is not an exchange. It is a protocol which allows for asynchronous price discovery and continuous liquidity. This means that converting a smart token does not require matching two parties in real time with opposite wants, rather, it can be completed by a single party directly through the tokenäó»s smart contract.So, unlike exchanges where you have to find someone who actively wants to buy what youäó»re selling, smart tokens are always completely and immediately liquid regardless of trade volume. 2) There are no similar currencies at the moment. 3) There are four use cases. Token Shares, which are continuously liquid tokens. Token baskets, which connect non-smart-tokens to the bancor network and thereby give them full liquidity. Token baskets, which hold multiple currencies in their reserves at different percentages of total value, allowing you to invest in multiple assets at chosen percentages (like an ETF). And token networks, which connect other smart tokens together (BNT itself is the main token network token).4) Problems Solved: The double coincidence of wants problem in asset exchange. That is, the problem of finding someone who wants what you have to sell and has what you want to buy, in real-time.The invention of money was the solution to this problem in barter. The invention of Bancor is the solution to this problem in asset exchange."
2434,Successful,bancor,"Well the owner would make money via holding the token changer smart contracts.So if, when Alice creates the XYZ/BNT token changer, she also purchases a bunch of that token changer's smart tokens, she would see their value grow by x% with every transaction the token changer processes. The fee wouldn't go to her directly, but she would be able to 'access' it by liquidating her token changer smart tokens for a higher price than she bought them for (the price having risen because of the reserves having grown as a result of the fees being added to them).The key thing to understand here is that a token changer works both as a mini exchange (that exchanges XYZ for BNT) and as a token itself (so you can hold XYZBNT tokens that get their value from the XYZ & BNT in the token changer's reserves).Make sense?"
2435,Successful,bancor,"We already hold BNT. Aprox half of it. But if we spend ETH to artificially raise the price of BNT above its market value, it likely to be lowered again by people who want to cash out at the higher price point, leaving us with less money than we started with as the price of BNT falls with every liquidation "

2439,Successful,bancor,"Its clear,  that price will grow,  but how owner of  exchange smart contract can make money? Imagine the case.There was an ICO,  and Alice managed to participate.

2444,Successful,bancor,"> No developer in his right mind will accept BNT as his entire salaryI know of many developers who are able to receive their salary in crypto or fiat and if they chose crypto (depending on the co/context) they get it at a premium.  Some will only pay in bitcoin.These are liquid virtual currencies. Many tech companies incentivize  developers with shares.  Often they are paid well below market and given options.   you say BNT is not a share in a company and that is correct but there are many parallels.> If microsoft decides to buy their own stock, it's usually because they see a cheap opportunity to retain a portion of control of their own company back.With respect, that is not at all correct. It has nothing to do with voting (control) it has to do with being able to issue those shares from treasury and they believe that the investment vs. holding cash is a good one.This is not manipulation it is a question of choosing what currency - virtual or fiat - to hold their capital.  If they believe in Bancor then why not hold in BNT!  Of course they will need fiat for operations, but since they have not been transparent about those funds, why not chose their own currency?  The answer could be that they don't want the risk, or perhaps they have already done so....  many possible answers but I assure you when a company buys its own stock, the value increases in part because they are putting their money where their mouth is!"

2485,Successful,bancor,Is there a way to earn money by creating exchange? 
2486,Successful,bancor,Thanks very good answer will do some research.
2487,Successful,bancor,"Depends what you want to do with your token.  It would be just like any other token in existence right now.  Many tokens serve different purposes.Your token would gain in value as more people purchased and used your token, so yes you could ""make money off it"" by holding your token and if it becomes popular/ people buy it the price increases.  Just how any other token works.The supply of your token is a little bit different.  The way the Bancor price discovery formula works is when you purchase from the smart contract, you would deposit ETH/BNT and that would be added to the reserve of your token and then the smart contract would then create and issue you your token.  This increases the supply of your token but also increases the price/ value of your token.  I suggest reading the Bprotocal white paper for better clarification.  And the opposite is true, when you sell your token back to the smart contract it is destroyed and you are issued the ETH/BNT back from the reserve.  This formula always ensures your reserve ratio is constant.The market would dictate the price once you create your token but the initial starting price can be decided by you.You will also have the option to decide what CRR (constant reserve ratio) is best for your coin.  This will impact liquidity of your coin.  The lower the CRR the more drastic the price movements will be when people buy or sell your coin.  The higher the CRR, the more liquid it will be and buys/sells won't move the price as much.I don't pretend to be an expert on Bancor so these answers are to the best of my understanding of the protocol so far.  If Im mistaken on anything or have not explained anything perfectly, please chime in.  I'm still learning the protocol myself [EDIT]Also forgot to mention, if your an early adopter, your coin can benefit also based on network effects.  Since your coin would hold BNT as its reserve, when BNT gains more popularity and usage, your coin would increase in price even if no one bought your coin.  Similar to how the BNT price moves up in USD when the BNT:ETH ratio stays constant.  Since BNT holds ETH in its reserve, when ETH increases so does the price of BNT."

2552,Successful,bancor,"Among the various value propositions of bancor, I can appreciate the stability it provides. I saw a nice Arbitrage opportunity today on an exchange and watched how the price Discovery mechanism and exchange found parity. The interesting part was how it slowed down the crazy Market. Now I realize that some may find this as a flaw in the smart contract, but as I participated directly, the experience of seeing the stable liquidity of the smart contract ground a crazy Market was really powerful. It reminded me of an IPO where the underwriter has an overhang that they can allocate to stabilize a new offering. I saw this during the Facebook IPO and there was basically a guarantee that the price would not fall below a certain amount because the underwriter acted as a market maker to ensure a price floor.  In that case, just like like the bancor price floor it lasted a short while and then the price dropped.  The price Discovery will also slow things down in a crazy Market provided the reserves don't get consumed.  I'm starting to get it, but need to see more demand before getting too excited!"

2557,Successful,bancor,Already walked!
2558,Successful,bancor,"Yeah. What we're seeing (some of us, at least) is an evolution in the making. A token that anyone with ETH can purchase, through a *decentralized solution*, at market prices and with *adjustable* liquidity (CRR). Arbitrageurs are financially incentivized to balance the smart token price with the prices on other exchanges while increasingly utilizing fully automated solutions to remain competitive.We may be looking at the future of liquidity."
2559,Successful,bancor,"I think our differences of opinion come from differing views on market incentives and dynamics. I simply don't think we're going to see the kind of price divergence between the contracts and the exchanges that you predict, at least not for much longer. And that's one of the big benefits of the contracts.It will take volume to move the price, it's not going to spike as easily as other assets. It might be more likely to drop out though - or seems like there would be less resistance to money flowing out when there's a problem than to money flowing in on good news."
2560,Successful,bancor,"It doesn't have to happen in the order I described to screw over holders?  The arbitragers can just buy and buy from the low smart contract price until the smart contract price exceeds the market price.  The point is that you assumed the risk buy buying the token early on, and yet these arbitragers can come in and buy for a low price without assuming any of that risk.  We're also assuming that the token is only used as a currency and doesn't bestow any profit sharing or voting rights.  "
2561,Successful,bancor,"Why on earth would anyone be buying it at that price on the traditional exchange when it's available directly from the smart contract for a much better price? We did see this some post-ico, people selling below the price floor on exchanges, etc., but I think this was a literacy problem, with people not knowing how to (or that they could) use the smart contacts. Literacy will grow in time, and the UI for utilizing the smart contact will improve. Both of these will mean less trading at values diverging from the smart contract price.Why would the price disparity you describe actually happen? If people are buying on exchanges, there's going to be heavy arbitrage on the way up and competent buyers will be buying from the contract directly.I don't think it's likely to occur for much longer, but even if it does your scenario doesn't. steal value from other holders. Either they keep holding and their value grows as arbitragers find the equilibrium, or they sell on an exchange at the higher price (or buy more at the lower contact price). "
2562,Successful,bancor,"Stoxx is using Bancor. I don't know which benefits they're most interested in. I didn't look too closely at it. My guess is they're after the price stability that presumably comes from the pricing algorithm and bancor as the reserve token."

2564,Successful,bancor,"Hi - clarification since you seem very well informed.  Was BNT used in the Stoxx ICO?  If not, why? Are they simply using it for liquidity at some point in the future to supplement the exchanges?  Do we know when?

2567,Successful,bancor,"Basically your are saying that you don't like Bancor price discovery mechanism because it gives a different price to an asset then a traditional exchange.But that difference works both ways, if price on exchange drops below bancor contract price then arbitrage creates new HIGHER equilibrium price."

What's the opposite of FUD?Anyway here's how it would happen:  Let's assume the true market equilibrium price is $10 but the smart contract price is $1.  So someone swoops in and buys a token from the smart contract for $1 and then sells it on the open market for $9.99.  Then the next person buys it from the contract for $1.01 and sells for $9.98, and so on and so forth until the smart contract price matches the new LOWER equilibrium price.

At this point, it appears we are just holding as insurance against whichever next news announcement or attention from a big whale comes along, so we guarantee a good price.  Some well-set alerts and a constant eye on the news might be a cheaper insurance, but hey - maybe we're not the brightest, or can't afford such vigilance.   As the others said though - if you don't believe in the potential of BNT then you probably shouldn't be holding any at this point.  We're all just buy-and-holding hoping for a big gain over time.  Eh, it's not the worst strategy, I suppose.Hmmm...

Smart tokens will still be driven by market demand.

2643,Successful,bancor,"> Very good point, but it could be slowly rising, why not - that is my main point.What do you want Bancor to say about the price? This is not rhetorical, I'm asking. The only ways in which they have control over the price (the tokens they own) are already known variables (the roadmap for how the tokens will be spent, the tokens that are time-locked, etc.). They may be able to manipulate the market with announcements/media, but I don't see this as a positive for long-term success or credibility. It isn't rising because there isn't more money flowing in, likely because the value hasn't been demonstrated, which is the thing they're working on.I guess the main thing for me is that they don't have control over the price beyond the utility they can bring to the token which will influence its demand, and thus price. It isn't their stock, it's a component of their product. It just seems strange to me to feel like they should have anything much to say about its price - the focus (and speculation) should be on the product (which will drive the price). I'd certainly like to see things moving faster, just as much for what it means for the token price and to actually USE the product (TOKEN CHANGERS!), but it sounds like many of the holdups at this point are regulatory/legal, and if slower means fewer legal and regulatory problems in the future I think that's good for everyone.You're right, that last statement is worded in an aggressive and arrogant way. Sorry about that, it wasn't the intent. The point wasn't to call you out or embarrass you (or anyone else) for not understanding it - was meant to express a generalized opinion of my own and should have been worded better. I'll put a little bit here and there into the random cryptos in the hopes that one might explode, and to hedge against loss in others, but there's no way I would invest enough to care much about in anything I didn't understand and know how to get information on. ([see number 7](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/24/10-warren-buffett-quotes-that-teach-us-about-inves.aspx)) That's just way more risk/faith than I'm comfortable with.Bancor could well go much lower before it goes higher - who knows. I think most of the folks here are primarily fairly long on Bancor, expecting that the product will, in time, be useful enough to be extremely valuable. A lot of the folks here are also interested in it as a technology and tool, in its applications. Maybe not, but that's my impression.>Furthermore, I'd like to know if any of you are willing to disclose a financial relationship with Bancor. Looking at /u/envyvulpes09 ...I can't speak for /u/envyulpes09, but I have no affiliation with them besides holding a small amount of their token.

2654,Successful,bancor,Nicely written and very precise_ôï_ôé
2655,Successful,bancor,"Keep in mind that Bancor is unique. Its price is not set by the trading activity of only the participants actively trading, but by the market as a whole, including the holders that aren't actively buying or selling. That means that its price can't be driven up or down by low-volume movement on exchanges like the others. The value hasn't continued to drop because people mostly stopped selling or there are enough people that believe this is a good price to create equilibrium with those that are selling. Likewise, the price isn't going to spike because of a small fraction of the market trading at higher prices, it will take more money flowing in over time to dramatically raise it, which will likely only happen as the platform is developed and used. It's not a failing asset, the price in ETH has been stable for weeks, and ETH has been going up.The team made a statement a while back saying essentially that they have to ignore the price and just work on development of the platform. What are you expecting them to do about the price? The best thing they can do is keep developing (improve the fundamentals) and they're doing it.The Stoxx price isn't in Bancor's hands either, it's in the markets hands. Many ICOs see a price drop after the ICO, this is not unique to Bancor or Stoxx. With these assets, there's also a little more transparency about what's happening in the market, as the price reflects supply in a way other assets don't. It's also not Bancor's responsibility to push/market Stoxx. (Edit:) I'll also add that Bancor should be deliberate about NOT pushing any tokens using their system, as it would create some bad press and bad feelings if they push tokens that wind up being scams or that wind up failing, and some inevitably will.So what has the Bancor team been doing - well, I don't spend a lot of time keeping up with it, but my understanding is that they're just awaiting legal review for launching the first token changer contract. Once the first one is at least briefly proven in the wild, others will be released shortly thereafter. They also indicated they've got a growing queue of people working on other ICOs for various tokens using the Bancor system, Stoxx just happened to be the first one ready (the delays in the others are probably delays caused by the teams launching them, as they develop proof of concept demos, tweak whitepapers, develop marketing materials, recruit team members and advisors, etc., but that's just my guess). I imagine they're also working on other aspects of their platform - if you're worried, maybe you should check in with them on telegram where they seem to do most of their ongoing communication.I'm sorry, but your whole post comes off as either poorly conceived FUD or ignorance. If you don't understand the asset or the organization, you shouldn't have your money in it."

I see nothing wrong with that. Better than nothing.You dont seem to understand that Bancor and Stox are different entities either. Yes, they raised $150 million, but this extra $150 million you are talking about is going to a different project. By this logic, you would not have bought into Bancor because the Ethereum ICO raised so much money. You are only giving Bancor a very small amount of money (4%) by investing in stox.  Wait until after this happens, you cannot really complain about something that never failed yet, I don't see you making any good crypto currencies. Just invest in something else if you dont like it."

Your disappointed it's the first and not a more reputable company in your eyes.From what I understand, after the ICO is complete and their hard cap is met, the BNT reserve will be created and soon after one will be able to purchase directly through the smart token.  I guess it depends how quickly Stox reaches it's funding goal and then how quickly they get it up and running using the Bancor protocol "

2872,Successful,bancor,"This just an ads....And btw its BNT."
2873,Successful,bancor,Why
2874,Successful,bancor,"I agree.  This is pretty ridiculous.Nobody around here is begging for ""protection"".In fact, I'd guess that *most* people involved with crypto recognize the free market principles at play and actually seek them out rather than beg for protection from them.Thankfully, the SEC basically said (for now at least) that nothing is going to change."
2875,Successful,bancor,"I think the SEC is overreaching. They cannot govern ICOs that occur in other jurisdictions. They also cannot prevent Americans from wanting to participate without SEC ""protection""."
2876,Successful,bancor,"I'm not sure why countries outside the US would want to submit themselves to the US SEC. If they're raising funds for their company, they'll just exclude the US. I think the vast majority of ICOs will be for raising money and investment purposes. "

2880,Successful,bancor,These are reasonable thoughts.
2881,Successful,bancor,Would The DAO be a security if there were no curators?
2882,Successful,bancor,VCs take equity.  ICO is free money.
2883,Successful,bancor,"If you read the actual SEC decision, there are a lot of elements required for something to meet the definition of a security.  I don't think Bancor tokens meet them.  The DAO was essentially just a hedge fund that stored its ownership records on the blockchain.  Of course their tokens should be a security.  "
2884,Successful,bancor,can you give reasoning as to why Ethereum is a ticking time bomb?
2885,Successful,bancor,Thanks.
2886,Successful,bancor,No just the opposite.

2891,Successful,bancor,August 2nd
2892,Successful,bancor,They are registered in Switzerland because the regulation in Israel is more similar to the U.S.
2893,Successful,bancor,"I barely think that there is any ico registered in US and they all say the same that they did not sell any tokens to US citizens, but we all know that most of the buyers were from US using vpns and ect.. just must admit that BNT at least not even close to be called a security cause there are no dovidens or voting power.."
2894,Successful,bancor,"The SEC ruling was very specific about the details of TheDAO tokens being assets, mainly holders got payouts ( e.g dividends) and voting power (e.g. share holder rights). Bnt will be in a grey area where some tokens will payout fees. Also, they are registered in ~~Israel~~ Switzerland rather than the US. The ICO was not officially open to US passport holders."
2895,Successful,bancor,Hi - we reverted the transaction yesterday so you should see the BNTs back in your account.
2896,Successful,bancor,I'm sick of the hey we are raising money in a compleatly decentralized way and holding funds in a multi sig wallet. At that point just go to a VC.
2897,Successful,bancor,has stox announced there ico date yet
2898,Successful,bancor,Agreed. Price chart is very irrelevant at this point. Expect to see the price increase when bancor reserves are dumped into stox
2899,Successful,bancor,"BNT-BTC chart is just silly, it might as well be ETH-BTC with minor margin errors."
2900,Successful,bancor,"I am leaving my original post in case others have the same question, but through further research I have come across an answer. From the [bancor faq](https://www.bancor.network/faq/common):> Having said that, the smart token creator does not need to devote these funds to the reserve forever, since it is possible to set a smart token with an adjustable CRR (within a pre-set range) that would allow the issuer to withdraw some of the reserve as the smart token user base grows (and its market-cap and organic liquidity, with it). >The reserve can actually be seen as a temporary deposit, and in some cases, as a future source of additional funds (when the issuer decreases the CRR)."
2901,Successful,bancor,they have subreddit here. https://www.reddit.com/r/STOX/

2903,Successful,bancor,The bug never displayed the price floor incorrectly. it was always accurate according to the price floor reserves. what it displayed incorrectly was the daily volume.
2904,Successful,bancor,"You know, that's what I assumed initially, that there was a bug that caused the price floor contract to display incorrectly. Of course, some hacker might have caused that bug and then encouraged the stampede."
2905,Successful,bancor,Learn some goddamn english
2906,Successful,bancor,Not yet!!!
2907,Successful,bancor,Awesome! Exciting stuff to look forward to!!
2908,Successful,bancor,"You're not in a position to call anyone a retard, if you invested in Bancor... just sayin"
2909,Successful,bancor,"If making money was easy, everyone be rich here.  I will give you this advice.  If you try to trade on market with logic and reasoning, you will move slowly with the market.  Meaning your gains will be minimal.  You make risky trades, you should have more margins because you are either going the right direction or the wrong direction before everyone else.  Most of my accidental trades and bad trades always net me the most gains.  Can't explain it, but overwhelmingly it rings true for me.  Looking at BNT, there is the reasoning that pegging the value to 1/100 of ETH was a guarantee the developers wanted to offer to investors.  This meant that the worse you can do is get a full refund minus the fees.  Not a bad deal for them trying to eliminate any risk.  What people thought was, there was no way but up from here.But in reality, that didn't happen.  Maybe the pegging of ETH actually depressed the value of BNT somehow.  Now that floor is removed; it is no holds bar.  Look what happened?  Nothing so far.  Logically if BNT couldn't go up in value on the market even with insurance.  What happens when you remove the insurance?  It should only stay or go lower.So given that logical theory, the opposite will likely happen.  Smart people wouldn't touch this.  The price will go up and most people will miss the opportunity when it goes on a bull run.  The only formula that is unknown is how high will it climb?  50%, 100%, 500%, 1000%?  That is the real risk, you don't know how much time your money will be tied up and you don't know how much it is projected to be.  50% gain would be a waste of time in the crypto market."

The FUD organizers probably only needed to sell a million BNT to the PFC, while they spread the FUD to the right places to start the avalanche. "
2936,Successful,bancor,Aaaand look at the price now!
2937,Successful,bancor,"This sounds brilliant! Thanks for the clarity.I really like that your plan has a lot of reasonable avenues to adoption, providing some redundancy - just in case.Also, I'm grateful for the regular communication. I'll try to support you guys, in any way that I can."
2938,Successful,bancor,For what?
2939,Successful,bancor,Hi there! You can receive $BNT by shifting it from any other digital asset we support. You can see a step-by-step example here: https://info.shapeshift.io/about Let us know if you have additional questions. 
2940,Successful,bancor,Awesome! A lot to look forward to. Thank you for being so transparent.
2941,Successful,bancor, i have invested in alot of crypto startups over the past year and half but i can honestly say as far as communication is concerned the bancor team is a winner while it is important to have great coders which is most projects focus it is also important to have real world experience and research applied to your goals and i can see for sure that the bancor team has that 
2942,Successful,bancor,ignore price long hold. hope everything goes well.
2943,Successful,bancor,"The ERC20 tokens are tied to your private key, you can view them with compatible wallets. Jaxx supports some but for ICOs where the tokens are brand new Mew and a few others are probably your best bet. "

2945,Successful,bancor,Good on you guys
2946,Successful,bancor,"Honestly I think is the right approach, nice to see a systematic plan for each area and the breakdown of opportunities. "
2947,Successful,bancor,"Nah, it's far more simple.A bug in the website API shown a huge amount of daily volumes. that got propagated to coin market map, which suddenly shown the BNT smart contract as the biggest volumed ""exchange"" in Ethereum's markets, that in turn spiked fear that a major whale stampede began, and ironically, caused exactly that to happen.Check out the dates. the beginning of the price floor depletion corresponds to the spike in volume, which is an API bug and not the actual volume."
2948,Successful,bancor,"So, has anybody successfully acquired $BNT #Bancor Tokens through #ShapeShift? How is this possible? https://info.shapeshift.io/about"
2949,Successful,bancor,"SO, has anybody ever tried this and succeeded?"
2950,Successful,bancor,Assuming it goes back to 0.01 ETH lol
2951,Successful,bancor,"For the same reason bank runs happen. No one wants to be left holding the bag. And I mean the logic behind selling has borne out. Who knows when, if ever, the price will recover back to the floor."
2952,Successful,bancor,"Right, but why did nearly holders of nearly 10 million BNT decide it was suddenly time to sell, all while ETH was recovering from the $130 lows?"
2953,Successful,bancor,"sell this pos while it is over $2.buy when it pumps. dead money for awhile"
2954,Successful,bancor,"If the ""market"" is of the current opinion that the value of a token is less than 0.01 ETH and a price floor is in place, it's not difficult to imagine a scenario where the floor gets wiped as fast as it did. Under these circumstances who would be buying? Sellers have one willing buyer, the floor contract. So every seller is going to use the floor contract to bail them out, thus draining it in a matter of hours."
2955,Successful,bancor,"Again incorrect. I assumed nothing, I simply pointed out your post history and contents. "
2956,Successful,bancor,Says the troll that did exactly that upon starting this stupid conversation.

2958,Successful,bancor,You seem really offended.  You must be one of the new amateurs that lost money.
2959,Successful,bancor,I don't like clowns. 
2960,Successful,bancor,Good to know you have the time to search through months of posts of random people on reddit to try and come up with an insult.
2961,Successful,bancor,Right...I'm sure you were. 
2962,Successful,bancor,"You literally think that this is my first reddit account.  It was created this year you dolt.  I was trading bitcoin before you knew what it was, most likely."
2963,Successful,bancor,"You literally just started posting about crypto 2 months ago, you must be such a seasoned sage..."
2964,Successful,bancor,Still a lot of shaking of weak hands to be done. Price continues to head south. It's now at 0.0091ETH.
2965,Successful,bancor,"Please do, because the way I see it, fiat also stores value, and this value is transferable. Money also effectively incentivizes human behavior, which is why you get paid in money when you do work. I believe that Bancor will do this *easier*, but I don't see a situation where you can't replace the word 'token' with the word 'dollar' and get the same result, eventually. "
2966,Successful,bancor,"Explain to me how the Price Floor Contract stays above like 90% for over a month, all while hovering not much higher than 0.01, then is entirely depleted in what, 3 days? Looks to me like an organized hit. And from someone who didn't understand the fundamentals of the price floor either, as in they though destroying the floor would send BNT to zero, but that's not how it works."
2967,Successful,bancor,"The floor was an afterthought after Bancor brought in way more money than it needed in the ICO. BNT sold to the normal price contract is deleted. But BNT sold to the price floor contract is kept by Bancor. So after the Price floor contract ran out, Bancor ended up with a few million extra BNT for themselves, and whoever sold to the price floor basically got a refund on their ICO investment.I don't see a problem here.The smart contract is the platform, it simply needs a ui. Here's the ui demo https://blog.bancor.network/the-bancor-platform-demo-v1-2-10e3459489dbit is pretty cool."
2968,Successful,bancor,"Well, since a lot of people still don't understand they can buy new BNT from the smart contract instead of exchanges who knows."
2969,Successful,bancor,"Manipulation to depress price to exploit arbitrage. No more free arb, people stop manipulating, less BNT in circulation, price rises."
2970,Successful,bancor,"Bancor didn't just give away free ETH though. They keep the BNT sold to the price floor contract, but not the BNT sold to the normal contract that is destroyed.>How about we stick to the basics from now on? You know, like NOT INVESTING UNTIL THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRODUCT?The smart contract IS the product. That's it. They're just building a UI on top of that with the ability to create more smart contracts. Please read the white paper."
2971,Successful,bancor,"People bought a few coins and then expecting the moon a month later _ôÖ_ noobs. "
2972,Successful,bancor,Revolutionary indeed. Great to be on the ground floor!
2973,Successful,bancor,It's revolutionary because tokens have stores of value and with Bancor this value can be transferable. So what tokens can do effectively is incentivize human behaviour which I think will lead to a very powerful value proposition. I'll elaborate with examples in a post later when I have the time. Sorry about not including them here.  
2974,Successful,bancor,"Good, we weeded out all the annoying amateurs that flooded the crypto scene in the past 2 months jumping on every ICO expecting to get rich overnight, then panic sell when the price doesn't move the way they want immediately.  Bancor technology is amazing, just gotta wait until the app goes live to mainnet."
2975,Successful,bancor,"That the Bancor team suggested you post a write up hyping their service is not surprising, I'm merely cautioning against broad hype posts in general, as one of the main criticisms of Bancor and its investors is that they/we are not grounded in reality. Comparing Bancor specifically, and not Ethereum as a whole, to 'the next World Wide Web' is a bold claim. In my mind the analogy works if you scale it up one level. Bancor may well be the Amazon or EBay of Web 3.0, and I hope it will be, but it isn't going to be the whole kit and caboodle. I'm trying to imagine what unimaginable things you think Bancor will do...it's a platform for creating tokens. That's what it will do. Tokens can do anything you want them to that normal currency will do, but it will be liquid and solve the asynchronous coincidence of wants problem. There's nothing magical about that, it's cool, sure, but it isn't as ephemeral and earth shattering as the web was."
2976,Successful,bancor,"The analogy here is simple and used to address a broader point. Money is a form of communication or speech. Money communicates value. See: https://a16z.com/2016/07/24/money-as-message/In the most recent past money creation has been limited to state actors, sort of how in the past publishing houses were the primary if not exclusive method of effectively creating and publishing content. The internet allowed people outside of the publishing world to create and publish their content. Nevertheless, it was not until the Web came along and delivered the necessary tools to the broader public that creating and publishing content on the internet really took off. Bancor is doing something similar on the Ethereum platform, but for money creation rather than content creation. Anyone can create a liquid and more useful form of money using Bancor (as opposed to just creating a standard ERC20 token). Which leads to the point of the post: As difficult as it was to imagine the amount and variety of content produced by the web, it is equally difficult to imagine the amount, types, variations, and purposes of future Bancor-based tokens."
2977,Successful,bancor,"You need to understand how analogies work. ETH is absolutely built on principles shared by crypto as a whole. Particular web pages can be networks as well. ""Amazon.com"" is a webpage...it also has millions of subpages, all networked together. Your claim that bancor = the web is ridiculous, considering bancor has yet to release *any* tangible asset. I own BNT, I didn't panic when everyone else sold out to the floor, I believe in this project long term, but GTFO with this fairy dust pixie land bullshit. You do no service to the Bancor community by putting out ideas that make us look like moon eyed idealistic children."
2978,Successful,bancor,"ETH is not built on ""cryptocurrency as a whole"" nor is Bancor an ENS address or a Dapp. It is a protocol and network of smart tokens, and therefore not analogous to a ""particular webpage""."
2979,Successful,bancor,"It was accelerated as it got lower, which we expected could happen, especially after such turbulence in the markets. There is no blaming.. Bancor had a largely uncapped token sale. I'm quite sure that if we had a lower hard cap like other ICOs, the price would skyrocket as soon as the trading started (given the unfulfilled initial demand), and the scalpers would have been, of course, thrilled! We chose a different path, and instead of making scalpers richer, we used the excess demand to provide some protection to the contributors, while allowing many more of them to participate in the initial price (10,800 of them).I suspected I would hear trolls bashing BNT for not jumping up like other, capped ICOs, and I believe weak hands should exit, leaving more profits to be realized by the strong hands who understand that we are just in the beginning, that we've about to activate the first decentralized token changer (GMO-BNT), and that the first ICO of a smart token has been announced (Stox.com).The good thing about markets is that they move capital from the hands of the less intelligent, to the hands of the more. Intelligent money usually does not participate in an ICO only to exit within 30 days, especially given that in the time in between, Bancor has release what is probably* the most advanced (an automated, dynamic market maker!) and the most used (in terms of [ETH volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/bancor/#markets)) production use-case for a smart contract on the Ethereum network. A contract that can guarantee high level of liquidity to any token, forever. The most significant live example for the usefulness of smart contracts, which is still doubted by many.*I may be wrong here because I don't know the volumes handled by other advanced, non trivial smart contract. I would thank anyone who can correct me or confirm this."
2980,Successful,bancor,"Hmmmm...2 day old throwaway account urging everyone to sell in like every thread in this sub. Stated motivation is ""I'm tired of seeing this ICO dropping and taking investors with it"". What an altruist, so concerned with fellow investors!Or probably just some asshole looking to take advantage of a panic and buy low. Obvious troll is obvious."
2981,Successful,bancor,"So infinity in the sense of not infinity?I think your analogy is ridiculous. If anything, cryptocurrency as a whole is the Internet, ETH is the web, and Bancor is just a particular webpage. "
2982,Successful,bancor,"You say this, but the selling of BNT accelerated AFTER ETH began recovering/rising. It's easy to blame it on the wider crypto mini-crash but it's not true. And as we can see now, the price has been slowly bleeding ever since. Anyone with half a brain cell should bail on this disaster ASAP."
2983,Successful,bancor,Thanks for the update

2989,Successful,bancor,"The public will probably not create a unlimited amount of Tokens as the Tokencreation requires a Reserve, therefore is not ""free"". However this aspect is necessary to make sure that the Tokens hold value and are interchangeable.I agree that the Number of created currenies will be great, probably Millions. "
2990,Successful,bancor,_ôÖ‰
2991,Successful,bancor,Even trolls deserve a chance ;)
2992,Successful,bancor,"Its a real pleasure to see other people being able to answer these questions about Bancor. Thanks you :)One small thing. The access we have to the BNT smart token while we still pilot and improve it, is temporary, and since it's public knowledge, it would probably be more appropriate to call it a ""front door"".Needless to say that anyone can create smart tokens right now that are fully decentralized with no front or back doors, but we would hardly advise this at this stage of the development.We have the option to upgrade BNT to be fully immutable and fully decentralized, as well as using a multisig where a consortium of industry veteran will hold the keys and use them only to when it benefits the token holders."
2993,Successful,bancor,Glad I sold out when I did. 
2994,Successful,bancor,"Yes, there is. the decentralized and trustless nature of the blockchain is what enabling it to happen. in essence, there is an interaction of true buyer and true seller. since the smart contract is the buyer or seller, the keeper of the reserves and the price setter, it basically means that every node in the blockchain is the buyer or seller, every node ""keeps"" the reserves and every node set the prices.Obviously, so long as Bancor keep their backdoors and their ability to destroy and issue BNT at will, the essential decentralized and trustless features of the forumla do not exist and we rely on the good faith in the bancor team. it does mitigate another factor over a trusted central server that does all of that trading and price setting and that is enabling the ledger to be more hacking resilient."
2995,Successful,bancor,This is a very clever mechanism to allow everyone to participate!
2996,Successful,bancor,I did not understand it. Thats why asked this stupid question. Now I got it.
2997,Successful,bancor,"Fair enough.But I don't see how you deduce that Bancor doesn't solve the coincidence of wants problem when the floor is gone, when you understand how Bancor works (which is in the whitepaper).The whitepaper clearly states how buying / selling works in a way that the market cap is kept constant. It doesn't stop at a certain price and is not dependent on having sufficient buyer / seller liquidity. Prices are to be determined by arbitrage.The floor being broken is in no way an indication that Bancor is not working as expected, and isn't vitally important for the project (It was a nice addition they did with some of the extra funds they raised)."
2998,Successful,bancor,"Thanks for this illuminating statement! This will lead to more understanding and more stability. Thanks a lot!By the way: There is not one word about the price floor in the white paper. I think this leads to a lot of confusion. How can someone, who is not that enlightened like you, know the difference between the price floor mechanism and the reserve token mechanism?"
2999,Successful,bancor,You think you're any better? You're prophesying a price fall of 90% and mocking people that disagree. It's actually kind of funny.
3000,Successful,bancor,Ship is still floating. How about that.
3001,Successful,bancor,"You mean the coin that just recently plunged from $420 to $150 within the past month? Yeah totally, safest bet."
3002,Successful,bancor,So you're going to try and time the market? Without any additional insider information (you don't have any) I don't think that's a good idea at all.
3003,Successful,bancor,Trying to pick winners is a pretty bad strategy. Diversification amongst what you perceive a strong candidate pool is a better strategy in such a volatile space. Taking all of your eggs from basket to basket is madness.
3004,Successful,bancor,"LOL @ ""lost all our wealth"". Pretty vast overstatement of how much BNT went above 0.01 ETH/BNT and how low it's fallen from it right now (currently 0.0093 ETH/BNT).    No one has lost anything meaningful yet. And there was no potential for huge profit-taking after BNT started trading after the ICO... so I don't know what you're talking about. Do you?"
3005,Successful,bancor,Don't go around waving your stupidity. Read the whitepaper.
3006,Successful,bancor,How can you know that I own BNT? I just get attention to BNT because of tweets about the price floor. Then I read the white paper. And after that I asked this question. Just in the process to understand Bancor.
3007,Successful,bancor,I'm so sorry you don't understand how any of this works. 
3008,Successful,bancor,"If it makes anyone feel better, I sold shortly before the price floor vanished but bought back in just now, I just didn't want to be holding the bag if there was a panic. Hopefully others will do the same. I bought about 8% above the ICO price, sold at the ICO price, and bought back in about 7% below, so I'm roughly balanced out now :)"

3010,Successful,bancor,Don't waste your time feeding the troll Eyul. Keep up the great work! 
3011,Successful,bancor,Down about 6% clearly hell did not freeze over. 
3012,Successful,bancor,"The way to measure it is to sample it in multiple exchanges for different assets, every time interval. That method should produce results people could use. I simply compared BNT to SNT since they were issued at the same time and had a similar market cap at the time.> Another thing which would be extremely helpful when creating your own tokens (or trying to predict how a current token will behave) is a simple web tool that allows you to enter starting parameters (token supply, reserves, CRR) and use a sliding bar to see the relationship between tokens bought/sold and price.Great idea!"
3013,Successful,bancor,"Eyal,I'd be very interested to see your analysis if you'd care to share it with the world.

3014,Successful,bancor,Ye shall know them by their fruits. 
3015,Successful,bancor,It has been over 9 hours. Why hasn't there been a public response to this request?
3016,Successful,bancor,It still provides a frame work for  the capability of long tail assets to be liquid .These assets  would not be tradable otherwise. It's a matter of adaptability. The double coincidence of wants problem is still being solved. People still can buy/sell their created tokens to the smart contracts created .
3017,Successful,bancor,yeah its a little late now that the price floor's been busted xD! thanks for your help though. 
3018,Successful,bancor,"Then you should really try again and follow the instructions properly. If didnt follow the instructions step by step that the only reasons it will hv error_amount is BNT in wei you want to sell_minreturn best put 1"
3019,Successful,bancor,Oh I know that it does. It must!
3020,Successful,bancor,Sounds very reasonable to me.
3021,Successful,bancor,"So far BNT price volatility is minimal even after dramatic depletion of price floor contract, to me that means that driverless car really works :)"
3022,Successful,bancor,"Yes, I have like 12 ETH in the same wallet the tokens are stored. "
3023,Successful,bancor,Yea I believe that people who wanted to convert their ETH to fiat probably raided their BNT stores to convert to ETH then to fiat.  
3024,Successful,bancor,"I agree. It's like saying that many people like to play the ""driving"" game (getting as fast as possible). And the full-time drivers actually make a living from it (Taxis..).Now let's say that the car is the ""liquidity"", the driver is the market-maker, and the passengers are market-takers. To this reality, Bancor is introducing a driverless car. So sure, people can still drive (although there are risks), however, there is no need for them to do it anymore."
3025,Successful,bancor,"For the same reason, BTC and ETH affect each other. We are in the same crypto space. Many have sold all kind of crypto currencies and tokens during this dip (which is not quite over yet). BNT holders who were liquidating their crypto positions were able to use the price floor, which eventually depleted it."
3026,Successful,bancor,"Nothing wrong with liquidating when needed. I was referring to the game of ""I'll liquidate now so I can buy more when it gets to the bottom"". It's always tricky to know exactly when that bottom was hit and the other players had started to buy again."
3027,Successful,bancor,"After Bancor token sale, ETH fell from $400 to $136 within a month. I assume this kind of volatility has a strong effect on holders of all cryptocurrencies."
3028,Successful,bancor,Same reason people sold at 130 and bought two days later at 260. Fear. 
3029,Successful,bancor,"Seems accurate. I've recently compared BNT/ETH contract liquidity to the highest volume SNT/ETH Market (Status.im on Bittrex). I found out that SNT had liquidity compareable to 2% CRR (In terms of how much the price would move relative to the percent of the supply being purchased or liquidated). So 4% CRR would itself provide a *new* market with *double the liquidity* for the asset. Perhaps 10% (BNT current CRR) could be too high of a setting for some tokens. For now I'm happy BNT is using such a reserve, as it is to be used as reserve for other smart tokens, and may require such exceptionally higher liquidity for itself."
3030,Successful,bancor,"So you imagine that this arbitrageurs bought BNT whenever it dipped below its price floor and then sold it after the Bancor team propped it back up to the price floor?  "
3031,Successful,bancor,"ETH did not lose 2/3 of its value during that period.  According to coinmarket cap, it was (very briefly) at $400 and is now at around $200.  "
3032,Successful,bancor,"I understand the sentiment, but it's not really a game, it's pragmatism. Personally, I spread myself across a variety of cryptos and hold, hoping for the market as a whole to go up. If I needed the liquidity though, or expected I might, I wouldn't hesitate to sell out of whatever had the bleakest short-term outlook."
3033,Successful,bancor,"Jesus it's amazing how many people own BNT without understanding it's fundamentals. The price floor didn't provide the liquidity. It was just a promise from the bancor team to keep bnt's value artificially high. Now the price floor is gone. You'll always be able to sell it back to the smart contract, you'll just get less and less value now, as opposed to the bancor team propping the value up. "
3034,Successful,bancor,I feel bad for you if you're a bancor investor and have this little understanding of how the platform works. 
3035,Successful,bancor,"Why would eth losing its value, relative to the dollar, have any effect on the bancor floor?  The floor was always measured in ether, not dollars. So why would ether losing value have any effect?"
3036,Successful,bancor,Did you hear about the first smart token sale? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIZEN4QiVw
3037,Successful,bancor,"A simple way to say it, is that it solves all liquidity problems. There is no more liquidity risk since liquidity is adjustable (CRR). Instead of solely relying on for-profit market-makers for liquidity, a smart token has a built-in, non-profit, automated market-maker, that ensures liquidity at all time to a different, highly liquid asset/s. Existing tokens can utilize Bancor protocol through a for-profit token changer."
3038,Successful,bancor,Just called George Soros. He assured me that he's not the one who broke the bank of Bancor
3039,Successful,bancor,"ETH lost 2/3 of its value during that period. A lot of money left crypto to fiat, so it shouldn't be surprising that BNT holders cashed out in such a stormy period.Also, it is important to stress that the price floor has nothing to do with the Bancor protocol and smart tokens. It's just a smart-contract based buy wall, to which we allocated all token sale excess funds (proceeds above the cap)We've announced stox.com issuing a smart token, you can imagine that they are not the only token issuer interested in guaranteed liquidity and adjustable price stability. This is likely to generate more demand for BNT, which is positioned to be the shortest (and cheapest) conversion route between any two tokens, on any blockchain (BNT will be transferable across blockchains)"
3040,Successful,bancor,I think this how market gambling works and it seems that a lot of people enjoy participating in that game.
3041,Successful,bancor,"If you do that, along with many others, you essentially entering into a reverse pyramid game, where everyone sells as they think the price will continue to drop, and the big losers in the game are all those who sold at the bottom.I personally don't like to play this kind of games."
3042,Successful,bancor,"Bancor has declared the token generation proceeds above the cap will not be allocated to the foundation, rather, the funds will be allocated to a price floor smart contract that will offer participants to buy back their BNT for the token sale price in ETH. It basically acts like a big buy wall in a specific exchange. 117k ETH were allocated to the price floor, and as ETH lost 2/3 of its value, it has been now depleted.This mechanism enabled us to let 10,800 contributors participate without a cap, while not collecting more ETH than we needed for the foundation."
3043,Successful,bancor,"No, this is just the beginning."
3044,Successful,bancor,"The floor was a mechanism to shift excess funds from the foundation back to the contributors. ETH crashed to a third. A lot of money left crypro back to fiat, and it obviously included BNTs. The good news is that the market seems to be slowly recovering but who knows in this crazy new space."
3045,Successful,bancor,Bancor was a system for redistribution of ether from ICO investors to  arbitrageurs
3046,Successful,bancor,The Bancor pricing formula disagrees with you. If you use their own spreadsheet you will see that even if Bancor team held onto their BNT and everyone else cashed in price would drop 98%. 
3047,Successful,bancor,"Bancor has now added substantial amounts of BNT to fund token changers and other Smart Tokens. In the process, they provided investor protection for a few weeks. * Raise more ETH than anticipated* Sell more BNT than anticipated* Slowly buy back BNT at ICO price (in ETH) from investors* And...end up in the same place you started from after providing a price floor for weeks. Not too bad..."
3048,Successful,bancor,"For the love of god, PLEASE SELL!Tired of seeing this stinking turd of an ICO dropping and taking investors with it.  The price isn't too far under ICO at the moment.  Cut your losses and liquidate to ETH.  Find a new project to invest in, because Bancor is sinking."

3051,Successful,bancor,Thanks a lot!
3052,Successful,bancor,You can still sell your BNT to the BNT smart contract which still has almost all of its reserves.
3053,Successful,bancor,Good one :D
3054,Successful,bancor,"How can I sell my BNT now without a ""buy back"" from the contract except on a trading platform? What if there is no buyer on a traditional trading platform. Then it's impossible for me to sell BNT. I thought that is exactly what they tried to solve (double coincidence of wants). But now, without the floor, i have the ""double coincidence of wants""-problem with BNT?"
3055,Successful,bancor,"Um, no.  It'll fall.The floor was investor insurance designed to encourage holding before Bancor released a working platform.  They miscalculated, the floor has gone, and now everyone who thought BNT was like ""ETH but with no downside"" is realizing that BNT is now like ETH but with the extra downside of having no working platform.  Or users."
3056,Successful,bancor,Idiot.
3057,Successful,bancor,"It solves the problem of idiots in the market.  They're clutching to BNTITANIC like nutjobs and sinking fast.Emotionally attached to the first ICO they ever got their hands on.I warned them for days that THIS EXACT THING would happen.  Arbitrageurs would eat the floor (a.k.a. ""free money"" - what a stupid, wasteful design flaw from Bancor), then people would dump and run.My prediction was dismissed as FUD.  Sadly, it was TRU, as any clear-headed investor could see.  But the warnings of me and others were downvoted as ""FUD! Fake news.  Fake FUD!  Nah nah nah can't hear you!""How about we stick to the basics from now on?  You know, like NOT INVESTING UNTIL THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRODUCT?And I expect this too will be downvoted.  Sadly, all the kiddie hodlers hear is FUD when anyone tells them that crypto isn't all lambos and moons and gainz.My advice?  Sell to ETH, step back, and REINVEST if and when Bancor actually releases a platform and announces clients.Not saying Bancor will never succeed.  But right now, it's hardly something worth holding."

3067,Successful,bancor,You mean like the giant price floor?
3068,Successful,bancor,I know it is illogical but I'm starting to think the price floor was keeping the price down and now with less BNT in the system (assuming the organisation doesn't sell it) the price will eventually rise.

3144,Successful,bancor,"This is because Bancor is unqiue in that its price is tied to Ethereum.  If Ethereum was still $400, we wouldn't have lost anything."
3145,Successful,bancor,Click the picture in imgur to zoom in and it should be perfectly clear :)
3146,Successful,bancor,"Why would it cost me money? Its not like i play margin, Its just paper loss.I believe it will bounce back, and i dont really care much about the price of the token that i buy during ico, its a hassle to bring it out from cold storage now. I just gonna buy more IF the price dip.Nobody know if it gonna dip, i dont have a crystal ball to really know IF the price will dip to 0.006-0.008eth. Its just a prediction.I wont risk my ico token."
3147,Successful,bancor,"Im sorry, cant really see your picture.You picture is too blurry"
3148,Successful,bancor,Why don't you sell now and buy back at 0.08? Because it looks like believing in the project will cost you money.
3149,Successful,bancor,"Shit sorry buddy linked to the wrong blog post. I have updated the OP.The actual spreadsheet can be found here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ns5fS7CvHyZyoxXC0GJWxd_ncsB04F3iAOb2dHHmtJY/edit#gid=877776767"
3150,Successful,bancor,"Again, just to clarify. This isn't my calculation but Bancors. I just took their spreadsheet and changed the input cells to get the above (see picture attache to OP). So are you saying their spreadsheet doesn't work when calculating price drops?"
3151,Successful,bancor,I cant see any calculator in the link you gave
3152,Successful,bancor,"no worries man and it is a stretch how I used it, but it can loosely apply. either way my choice of adjective is not really important, the fact that he didn't bring any facts that can be verified to the table in an effort to correct you is concerning"
3153,Successful,bancor,"Isn't that exactly what Bancor's own spreadsheet does?If I put 500,000 additional BNT bought into the spreadsheet it gives me the exact same value you just mentioned"

3175,Successful,bancor,"Flippers already got their 1.3x return when the token launched at the exchanges. Arbitragers made a killing too.

I like watching a good experiment unfold but I'm still uneasy because a lot of money is at stake. It's probably best for everyone that the price floor is taken out of play.

3180,Successful,bancor,"Yes this is correct.The price floor contract is bound to be burned sooner or later, its just a method where devs put for 'investor' that regret buying during ico etc.Imho, The price floor will deplete sooner or later. Better now than later on, clean up all the short term investor that didnt really invest in project but invest in ico for flipping.So that others holder can buy cheap later."

3187,Successful,bancor,"I really think part of the reason the market is so bearish against BNT has to do with the price floor.  Whales/ arbitrage traders can manipulate to get the ""free"" ether.

I don't think it has to do with insiders knowing something we don't.  Just greedy people "

3191,Successful,bancor,"Yeah I didn't expect it to drop this fast either.So has the team mentioned what they will do with these tokens? Are they essentially just hold it?"
3192,Successful,bancor,"Ether is on a bull run since yesterday. Moving to ether could be the safest strategy in the short term. Whatever it is, we will have to decide fast as the wall won't last very long.Bancor is the only token that is constantly selling below ICO price in terms of ether.

In retrospect I wonder if the price floor idea is flawed in its nature... all it does is provide the incentive for whales to manipulate the price/ and arbitrage traders to ensure the price stays near the price floor...  I commend the Bancor team for doing what they thought was fair, but maybe it isn't the best idea and keeps the price from being able to move upwards with all the selling pressure by manipulators "

3217,Mid,iconomi,"I love the US government and taxes.  To me, wonderful democracy is the rich putting their fate in the hands of the vastly outnumbering poor voters.  I donäó»t want to control or run from the poor.  I trust that I am smart and strong enough to live among them as equal free citizens, paying my share of taxes as they do.One of the best things I love about crypto and funds like BLX is that it gives the poor a chance to save by the same rules that the rich have.  Before bitcoin and BLX, poor saving was 0.1% in a savings account while vendors charged 5% more in fees to cover debit card bank costs.  That creates more poor.Before Bitcoin and BLX the most popular way the poor save $100 is in cash deflating 5% a year.Iäó»m tired of being poor, tired of loans, tired of banks and deflating government cash.  But I love democracy, taxes, and public info.  The CIA and IRS which I also love, is happy to have bitcoin over cash because its so much easier to trace.  Thatäó»s good for them and me.I just woke up and for some reason enjoy Trump style rants while I'm half dreaming still.  Twitter might be safer for me.The phishers and hackers deserve a place in this world too.  If we are stupid enough to leave our assets out or send them money, then it is our own fault.  Luckily most of the stupid are already poor and cant give phishers and hackers very much.  Like street theft, its always there and always balanced fairly.  There are safe places where you can leave a private key or $100 bill out to be taken, and it wont.  There are unsafe places too and it is already just how it should be.There are safe places to share your assets with thieves and the IRS and unsafe places.  There are people who avoid taxes and those who donäó»t and it is already perfect.  And always changing at the same time.I was given a $8,000 Rolex watch 25 years ago and still wear it daily.  Am I stupid or lucky?  I wore it as I grew to $600,000 in debt over 18 years because I wanted more shiny things than I had cash for.  I wore it afterwards as I drove a $600 geo metro, finally debt free.  I wore it when I decided to finally save $250k and avoid borrowing another home from a bank.  I rent now because I hate banks and loans.  I am a tax paying American.  I am a crypto coin user.

3225,Mid,iconomi,"Well pretty much all other projects figure out a use for the token BEFORE the launch of the ICO, you would expect that right?  You usually invest knowing exactly what you are investing in..."
3226,Mid,iconomi,"Just reminder for all:  it is unwise to mention your cryptocurrency assets online/on Reddit. This makes it much easier to link a wallet with a person, which can have many implications. Some of the implications can be a target for phishing/hacking, government tracking and tax implications. I am not suggesting to transfer your assets in such a way that you do not have to pay taxes, but rather in a way where you protect your assets from government control before the cryptocurrency rules are fully in place and clear."

3231,Mid,iconomi,"Great timing! With today's dip on the Chiba news, buying BLX makes a whole lot of sense. "

3253,Mid,iconomi,you can buy blx on an exchange...
3254,Mid,iconomi,You could but I wouldn't suggest it. there's no reason to pay a $1 more (A %50 premium) to get some. Just wait for it to hit the larger exchanges (And it will).

3256,Mid,iconomi,This needs to be available for US people already.
3257,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think it has to be lower than every single asset in the portfolio. Since ETH takes up a similar amount of the fund and it's volatility is much higher than BTC, I see BLX's volatility somewhere in between. However, I'm not an expert on portfolio theory, so correct me if I'm wrong."
3258,Mid,iconomi,BLX is going to trade on exchanges at a premium as long as US can't buy directly from Iconomi.
3259,Mid,iconomi,"I understand that perspective, but let me try to be precise on the need for utility...Market cap is supply * price. The theory is that buybacks alone will maintain (or even increase) market cap, and price will correct upwards, as supply decreases. There's actually no reason why that should be the case, without giving people a reason to want the token. This is *not* the traditional market, where you actually own part of the company. If it were, buybacks would work fine on their own.In the traditional economy, buybacks are similar to dividends (and often a better option) - the main thing to take away here is that this is *not* the traditional economy, and things work very differently in crypto. Cautious crypto investors aren't just going to buy a token because the company says they're buying them back...... hence all the talk of utility."
3260,Mid,iconomi,You are correct. You can buy them on etherdelta and then send them to myetherwallet. BLX is a great fund. It is outpacing most companies and bitcoin.
3261,Mid,iconomi,"Allow me to answer this in the most clear and precise way that I can. As an initial investor, I did not want some shitty app token, and today I still do not want some shitty use token. All I want is an equity split, it is all that I signed up for. I personally do not give a shit about what you think is missing or anyone else's dream list for a ""use case for ICN"". I just want the equity split, anything less would be fraudulent."
3262,Mid,iconomi,"As an addition observation, the number of ICN wallets is increasing.  On 7/31/17 I noted that there were a total of 9673 ICN wallets, now that number sits at 11499. So a total of a bit less than 2000 extra wallets in a month. Will be interesting to see how the number and contents of the wallets changes over time. "
3263,Mid,iconomi,"Although I like Vanguard and have from the start of this project compared the two, there is one glaring difference between Vanguard and Inconomi. Vanguard does not share profits, Iconomi does. Instead of distributing profits, Vanguard chooses to buy more things in order to run at a low to zero profit. "
3264,Mid,iconomi,"BLX includes 21 coins.  https://www.iconomi.net/dashboard/#/INDEXIf I send $1,000 to Fidelity and try to own the top 21 individual stocks, allocated by market cap or 15%, the fees and inability to buy fractional shares make it impossible.  If I send Coinbase $1,000 and also have a Bittrex account, I can mimic this 21 coin portfolio with similar fees.If I print paper ethereum and bitcoin wallets, or own a trezor, I can leave $0 at the exchanges, minimizing my risk and fees further.I've owned ICONOMI for months and just bought BLX today.  You guys are awesome and I thank you for what you are doing.  I will mimic some of BLX ratios in my own portfolio after seeing this.  Until today, I've been holding strictly by market cap with $10k in btc, 5k in eth, $500 in LTC etc...  You guys give me confidence to try a different ruleset.  I wanted to change it some myself, but i didnt trust just my uneducated gut so i forced myself to stick with market cap alone.  Thanks a ton.I will recommend BLX to my crypto class students who are just starting out and dont want to trade daily and own 200 coins like I do.Here is one of my wallets demonstrating market cap ratioshttps://etherscan.io/address/0xf567bed64cd70fbe00f63785f045aadcfe77c597Maybe you are hiring? :)"
3265,Mid,iconomi,I mean the Ticker API to get the official prices
3266,Mid,iconomi,Could you add the btc and eth prices too?
3267,Mid,iconomi,Been looking for it for a while. Thx for the info!
3268,Mid,iconomi,"Good builds. I agree and think the success of ICONOMI will (probably) lead to a mutually successful ICN token - however, my spidey senses are on edge due to little business need."
3269,Mid,iconomi,"Really?  Surely sophisticated investors buy the rumour?  There will clearly be a usage.  But that's okay, you wait for the news so we can dump on you. "
3270,Mid,iconomi,"Thanks for the value adding comments today, I feel this thread has generated good discussion without 'FUD' comments being thrown around. "
3271,Mid,iconomi,"True, I do. But it's a bit exhausting to see the same comment every time. Im confident they've thought about it thoroughly, and they already mentioned some things. Like you said, they only have to make it official. No need to comment every time there's no use for ICN...thats all"
3272,Mid,iconomi,"Added 7 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months percentages. I think I got the negative values covered but not sure, as everything is green again."
3273,Mid,iconomi,"Hmm, I'm showing the raw JSON file, so if I add a <div> it just shows on the page. Not the desired effect. Why don't you just use Excel? :)"
3274,Mid,iconomi,"You confuse FUD, with a legitimate question, or you don't think it's important that ICN still has no official purpose? "
3275,Mid,iconomi,"In EVERY post, there's always someone to spread the FUD. It's almost funny"
3276,Mid,iconomi,Except...a sophisticated investor would not invest in a token which currently has no actual purpose to fulfil...
3277,Mid,iconomi,"Hmmm... I don't think ED creates a temporary wallet for you. Basically it works like this:1. You access ED and unlock your wallet, for example Metamask. (Perhaps you used Metamask too and have created a wallet there protected by a passphrase.)2. You deposit a coin you want to trade in your case that probably was Ether which then is transferred from your wallet to the ED smart contract and associated with your wallet.3. You then trade your deposited Ether for an ERC20 token in your case these were BLX tokens.4. The final step is where you withdraw the traded tokens from the ED smart contract to your wallet.My guess is that you may have used Metamask or Mist, created an additional wallet and withdrew your tokens to that wallet address instead of your main wallet address. In order to verify if this is the case, please unlock that wallet using its software and check your BLX token balance. FWIW, you may need to add BLX as a custom token before the wallet will display your token balance.Good luck and let me know how it ends."
3278,Mid,iconomi,"BLX is in Blockfolio. Sync and search for 'Blockchain Index'. Although it uses the Ether Delta price, which is higher most of the time."
3279,Mid,iconomi,"Try to add BLX to MEW manually:Address: 0xE5a7c12972f3bbFe70ed29521C8949b8Af6a0970Token Symbol: BLXDecimals: 18"
3280,Mid,iconomi,Thats awesome that you did that.  I also wrote to Blockfolio support and they worked with me getting BLX listed with the developer.  Lets all do what we can to get BLX listed as much as possible.
3281,Mid,iconomi,"Req: If you make any changes to it, could you create a <div> with an ID to hold your <pre>?OpenOffice can read the page but it doesn't detect ""Tables"" with data. This may fix that. This is another reason my friend always says, ""Why don't you just use Excel?"""
3282,Mid,iconomi,"That's my biggest issue. I was not aware that EtherDelta creates a temporary ETH address when you trade on it, so I didn't save the private key to access it again and see what happened. If it's still on EtherDelta, am I SOL?"
3283,Mid,iconomi,"Specifically looking at BLX, not ICN"
3284,Mid,iconomi,"Sometimes it gives 0.00 as 24h change, but that's just because it says so on iconomi.net. Can't do much about it. I'll add the other changes (7d, 1m, etc..) later on."
3285,Mid,iconomi,Anyone else you suggest then?
3286,Mid,iconomi,"ItŒÇs a free market, tokens can traded anywhere at any price, same like with products in different grocery stores"
3287,Mid,iconomi,Both require the team to submit a request
3288,Mid,iconomi,Got it... ok thanks. Notes sent. Bittrex and Binance.
3289,Mid,iconomi,"Since the ICO, top 50s holder addresses are now listing into the 90s-100s with many of their holding amounts  unchanged. My guess would be that many these top holders are more sophisticated investors. 12 months of holding is a standard practice for anyone that deals in restricted securities, which is usually the equity sold with a traditional start up. A sophisticated investor would also hold to play long terms capital gains, generally 12 months or more, over short term grains. Most whales are whales not just in crypto and do not want to risk their other projects over some stupid decision, regulatory or otherwise, by taking questionable and unfavorable gains. Wait about 50 more days, that will be when the actual long game starts."
3290,Mid,iconomi,"Oh wait, that's the whole point.I'm a tool sometimes! Awesome! :)"
3291,Mid,iconomi,"We are only on EtherDelta because I asked them. I also wrote to Liqui too, but no response yet. If we donŒÇt do it it will probably take a while or will never happen, so feel free to help ;)"
3292,Mid,iconomi,"I only get a page that says this:[{    ""id"": ""blockchain-index"",    ""name"": ""Blockchain Index"",    ""symbol"": ""BLX"",    ""price_usd"": ""1.7437"",    ""percent_change_24h"": ""0.00"",    ""last_updated"": ""1504463884505""}]"
3293,Mid,iconomi,Nice. Maybe blockfolio could integrate it?
3294,Mid,iconomi,Excellent! Thank you. 
3295,Mid,iconomi,"I completely agree with Knowledge_1 that institutional investors will not be cross-pollinating with crypto investors.  I'm thinking more of the mom and pop investors that are the targets of referral campaigns and social media.  I know I'll be evangelizing Iconomi DAAs to my non-crypto circles once their insurance comes through and I suspect there are others in the community who will do similar.  I'm guessing there's a SWOT around the token and early adopter community and that treatment of the token plays into that.I agree with you on the Coinbase analogy.  It's also occurred to me that the future customer base won't care about the seed funders if they're making money hand over fist.  I'd probably overlook something similar if it was far enough in the past.  If it was recent, though, it would add to my risk assessment."
3296,Mid,iconomi,"Without any substantial usage the buybacks are meaningless and won't do anything to the price.I have a pile of dirt in my backyard. If I remove half of it every year each pound of dirt left does not become worth more."
3297,Mid,iconomi,"There you go, /u/JimmyMcTrade"
3298,Mid,iconomi,Boss!
3299,Mid,iconomi,"> Nope, you make a strong case.Haha, I didn't expect that! You make some good points also."
3300,Mid,iconomi,"I would love for the Iconomi team to give the ICN tokens some love and make them valuable for their own ecosystem. If it wasn't for us investors, it would have been much harder for the company to raise so much money, so it would just be fair if Iconomi would communicate better with us."
3301,Mid,iconomi,"Similar to what Knowledge_1 said... reputation is an important factor here, but I don't think our complaints would matter much to the success of the business.Imagine it were Coinbase. If Coinbase had some seed funding, but the original contributors were left with minimal return... would we know about it now, without doing some digging? Would Coinbase have been less successful?Of course, it's still a risk for Iconomi to think about. They can't know for sure how it would play out if (extreme example) they abandoned ICN holders.This is all just hypothetical, of course. I have a *feeling* Iconomi will do what's best for ICN. I just think it's worth thinking about in a bit more detail."
3302,Mid,iconomi,"We're not at $10 for BLX. $1.9 best we've seen, hovering around $1.7 currently.  "
3303,Mid,iconomi,">so how would you counter my argument? Can you explain how you see the incentive working here, in a way I've overlooked?Nope, you make a strong case. The only thing I would say is that they seem to have done a lot of the hard work already and the marginal cost to them to make ICN successful now seems small while the opportunity cost of fucking up now is comparatively large. They can burn some reasonable amount of ICN to open DAAs and the use-value people are happy, ICN does well, their reputation in the crypto community remains strong and they go on raking in money. If they decide on the absolute worst case scenario of cleaning out all the funds and hopping on a plane to Fiji well then that sounds pretty good too and it might be best for us to advocate for some kind of mechanism to prevent that. If crypto goes into a long bear market and ICONOMI loses money for an extended period then I would really be concerned about them giving up on ICN. "
3304,Mid,iconomi,"You rock! Thanks for taking onboard the suggestion.  I'm surprised by BLX's volatility, especially compared to BTC. Any ideas for an explanation? I was under the impression that it would be tempered relative to any single coin."
3305,Mid,iconomi,"> Everyone would trade their ICN for BLX if they would allow it on the platform.I definitely wouldn't. As I see it BLX is the conservative option. It's much more guaranteed to make a decent return where ICN is higher risk but also a potentially way higher reward in my opinion.If the team finds a good usage for ICN (which I believe they will) creating real demand, that could combined with the buybacks make the price absolutely explode."
3306,Mid,iconomi,"I agree that no brand wants their ICO investors to bad mouth them, however, I also recognise that as we are not their target consumer/demographic it doesn't really matter too much. In consumer goods, if your key demographic starts to bad mouth you, you're in trouble - as this directly impacts potential sales.In this case, we are a very separate group from 'big money' fiat investors - so risk of cross pollination of complaints is small. The P&L drives business decisions, and I think with ICONOMI this is the case. "
3307,Mid,iconomi,"If that risk has already been factored into the price then it can be a solid investment. Only time will tell, as with all investments."
3308,Mid,iconomi,"I've entertained similar thoughts about the cost/benefit of dropping buybacks and winding down ICNP to let investors redeem their ICN tokens.  I'll panic if the fiat gateways go online before ICN has an in-platform use.All that said, I do think Iconomi would rather not have to deal with salty token holders who'd be rearing to trash talk them anytime/anywhere.  I'm of the opinion that preventing that threat will keep the token in the road map."
3309,Mid,iconomi,"He said BLX, though."
3310,Mid,iconomi,"I've argued this in another thread, but that is not an incentive. I own a lot of toilet rolls, but nothing about my owning them gives me incentive to increase their value. (They come in multipacks. Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with me)The team are sitting on millions of dollars, and paying themselves god knows what. Any value ICN gains is only a bonus payment for them. They still get money regardless. OR they could slowly sell at this price, and get quite a lot already.The only real incentive they have to increase the value beyond its current value, is to do right by investors.I'm not saying they won't do right by investors... but owning tokens, alone, is *not* an incentive, from my perspective, because Iconomi will succeed anyway.You seem to have your head screwed on a bit more than some others round here... so how would you counter my argument? Can you explain how you see the incentive working here, in a way I've overlooked?"
3311,Mid,iconomi,"no joke, not there. made s screenshot too, but don't know how to send you or post on this blog"

3317,Mid,iconomi,"The success of ICN is not required for the success of the platform as far as I know. However, the incentive for the team to make sure ICN does well is that they own a giant amount of it."

3325,Mid,iconomi,Why can't this graph go back more than the last month?
3326,Mid,iconomi,"After reading all the FUD and all the HYPE i really do believe it just boils down to this. It does not matter if the answer for this question has already been answered. If it has been answered properly then it was a bad answer to the question as there is still confusion. Communication and objectives need to be totally clear and written in a way anyone can understand. The clearer the message the more people will understand. If you cant describe in a simple sentence what your business model does, you are failing at business.Iconomi need to describe what an ICN token is in a very clear and simple way, failure to do so will only create more ambiguity."
3327,Mid,iconomi,"> Buybacks are worse than dividends because the price hasn't increased yet?Yes.> Do you even know how small the profits were in the past ? If we'd have dividends, you would only have earned 10$ if you have 10.000 ICN in the past(without tx fees priced in)That's okay because then I could just hope for the profits and dividends to increase over time.Being assured that the token has a well defined purpose keeping the team interested to hold and maintain the token long term.Changing the token to ""has utility to open DAA"" on the platform looks much worse to me. These prices can be freely adjusted all the time by iconomi. They must not make it too expensive - otherwise DAA managers go to the competition (or start a competition). So the utility function sets upper limits on endurable (for users who need ot use it) ICN prices.If it was giving us dividends, then the price of ICN could skyrocket without thinking twice trying to hold the balance (since DAA managers won't have to pay a lot)."

If there is no link then there is underlying risk for us as investors. "
3333,Mid,iconomi,Why speculate speculative news?

3355,Mid,iconomi,"Ah getting downvoted, does this mean some of you still want to accumulate some more? Or just hate on me for having a positive feeling and outlook on ICN?"
3356,Mid,iconomi,"ETF means Exchange Traded Fund. Not every mutual/index fund is trading on exchanges - in fact most don't. The ones that do are called ETFs.As I remember Iconomi didn't plan to tokenize their funds (and make them possible to be listed on exchanges) at first. They changed their mind, which I approve, I'm just wondering how this will behave on the exchanges.Each ETF has two types of value:- NAV: net asset value, which is the value of all the assets it is holding.- Market price: ETFs price on exchanges which is determined by demand and supply for the ETF.These two prices are not necessarily the same - in fact most of the time they are not. Normally they would be pretty close to each other. But this is crypto - normal/rational does not always apply here :)What do you think guys, will BLX NAV and market price differ significantly?"
3357,Mid,iconomi,"Withdrawing BLX tokens and it's stuck in Pending.  No transaction ID assigned yet.   Initial transaction was started about four hours ago.   I got the email confirmation and clicked it.   I've done a few of these, normally they complete almost immediately."

3359,Mid,iconomi,Ain't that the truth 
3360,Mid,iconomi,"Oh, well its good for ICN holders and ICONOMI are giant ICN holders so I am pretty sure they will allow it. Also, it would be difficult or impossible to stop as long as BLX remains tokenized. "
3361,Mid,iconomi,I am just asking if Iconomi will allow arbitrage on etherdelta.
3362,Mid,iconomi,Thanks mate! Was checking BLX with no result :C . Too bad we can't see the price from Icononi platform.
3363,Mid,iconomi,Why would that be a good thing?
3364,Mid,iconomi,It pulls it off exchanges. Since BLX is only traded on etherdelta so far and the volume is so low the price isn't very accurate. More volume and more exchanges would fix that. 
3365,Mid,iconomi,"This Blockchain shit is permissionless, so if worse comes to worse I can trade my icn off via shapeshifte."
3366,Mid,iconomi,I don't think market cap or circulating supply make much sense in regards to BLX. 
3367,Mid,iconomi,I'm really wondering how CMC will keep up with an updated price.
3368,Mid,iconomi,"Looks like a classic crypto correction to me. No need to panick, in 2 days we're back."
3369,Mid,iconomi,"Whenever a BLX token is bought off of Iconomi's in house platform a new 'share' of the BLX fund is created and your funds go towards increasing the total portfolio allocations. When a BLX token is bought off of an exchange (Etherdelta) you are merely buying someone's share off of them, and no new funds are added to Iconomi's fund pool. In general at the moment it costs a large premium to buy BLX tokens on Etherdelta due to low volume and little recognition, often resulting in 20%+ premiums. "
3370,Mid,iconomi,They need to step up their servers. I don't want Iconomi crashing like Coinbase everytime there is a dip.
3371,Mid,iconomi,"What incentive would Iconomi have? Their target was to get BLX listed on exchanges, but due to the extremely low volume prices are high. Banning accounts for making profits off of BLX arbitrage would be highly unlikely and would likely make many investors (including myself) extremely cautious about Iconomi."
3372,Mid,iconomi,"It appears to be so. I'm not excited about it either man. I think with the recent dip/correction/crash they're getting a lot of people trying tomboy into BLX right now and it could be overloading them "
3373,Mid,iconomi,"But how will they find out? All they see is blx going out, eth coming in, blx out, eth in. Why would the amounts matter? "
3374,Mid,iconomi,Can Iconomi close the account of the sellers that selling BLX on EtherDelta? If they see to many BLX purchases and to many withdrawals.

3384,Mid,iconomi,"I just added BTC and ETH to my analysis. I only added BTC to the plot though, since ETH would highly distort the overall graph due to its crazy performance in the first half of 2017."
3385,Mid,iconomi,Blx was always an index fund . Don't know what you mean 
3386,Mid,iconomi,"BLX is on Blockfolio. Just type in ""blockchain index"" in the search bar (make sure you sync for the latest coin list)"

3389,Mid,iconomi,"When you buy into a mutual fund, youäó»re pooling your money along with other investors. You put money into a mutual fund by buying units or shares of the fund.Say you purchased 10% of the fund and the fund goes up 10%. Your % is now worth 11% instead as that % is matched with your investment. It's genuinely used to lower risk on investments by naturally diversifying. Link to showcase the importance of diversifying: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/111502.asp"
3390,Mid,iconomi,Is this sarcastic? I can't tell.
3391,Mid,iconomi,"100% agree, I mean investing in a token which currently has zero purpose seems like a great strategy doesn't it"
3392,Mid,iconomi,"well it rather depends on what the purpose is, and what quantity is required for said purpose doesn't it "
3393,Mid,iconomi,"Good point.I like the platform and I like BLX as well but I'll just hold it the ETH and wait. The last batch of BLX I got, I received 40 units for X ETH. Now, BLX is less but the same amount of ETH would give me 38 units of BLX. So I'll hold [sic]. ;)"
3394,Mid,iconomi,"How long is a piece of string? If you're holding for a long time, you never know whether the market is going to go up or down. My friends thought $17 ETH was expensive while waiting for a dip, when I told them to buy. They ended up paying 10x that. One bit of advice if you are new; time in the market is better than timing the market. "
3395,Mid,iconomi,So this means BLX is sort of a ETF now? (or will be when more exchanges list it)
3396,Mid,iconomi,Good point. I applied August 17.
3397,Mid,iconomi,I'd be actually quite curious to compare the volatility of BLX with the one of BTC
3398,Mid,iconomi,When did you apply for it?
3399,Mid,iconomi,isn't total == circulating for BLX? Token get created when people withdraw them from iconomi.net and destroyed when they are sent back? 
3400,Mid,iconomi,It's added!!!
3401,Mid,iconomi,"finally, I like Iconomi, let's hope they get to a rise now :D "
3402,Mid,iconomi,"OK, now I need two more things - BLX on blockfolio & Iconomi app on Android - and I'm set."
3403,Mid,iconomi,Most coins are in the red...
3404,Mid,iconomi,I agree with the sentiment but some of the BLX choices annoy me. I can't wait for DAAs.
3405,Mid,iconomi,Lol! :D
3406,Mid,iconomi,Go back to your cold beans Rorschach ;)
3407,Mid,iconomi,Well done whoever did that. Top notch.
3408,Mid,iconomi,"This is what I talked about in another thread.They set an order for a fraction of a BLX, and fill their own order. So, say they pay 0.005 eth for 0.005 BLX, it would register as 1 BLX priced at 1 ETH.You can never actually sell it at that price, 'cos it was just a one off. I think they just do it for a laugh :-P"
3409,Mid,iconomi,I think someone may have bought a tiny amount at a stupid price on etherdelta. 
3410,Mid,iconomi,I hope not :P
3411,Mid,iconomi,"This is great to see, gives a lot more exposure to Iconomi and their products!"
3412,Mid,iconomi,Has it actually been bought at that price?
3413,Mid,iconomi,"The official Iconomi app but I believe it's currently only available for iOS.Note that you can get BLX on blockfolio now as it's traded on Etherdelta.  "
3414,Mid,iconomi,This is awesome.  Get ready people.  I sense a rumbling of great masses coming our way!
3415,Mid,iconomi,Once total data is available cmc can show total and circulating supply.
3416,Mid,iconomi,"Already have, but it seems to be a problem from the exchange. Maby they will fix it after the weekend "
3417,Mid,iconomi,Can't wait until the data is correct. ;)
3418,Mid,iconomi,"Mine is not updating either, looks like a bug. "
3419,Mid,iconomi,Yeah. I can see ICN/BTC pair. May try sync on top right of screen when adding a new coin to your ptf
3420,Mid,iconomi,"Look at coinmarketcap, this is nothing more than the usual 2-4 day mini correction that 80% of the time gets triggered by weekend. No idea why it happens bit it happens all the time and the coins always recover within a week. No need to panic."
3421,Mid,iconomi,Sorry mate was thinking on BLX :)
3422,Mid,iconomi,What ccy pair you have ICN/BTC? As I have that and it correct. Maybe you have a fiat currency pair against kraken which they don't support anymore
3423,Mid,iconomi,"It can be slow to update at times but generally it is accurate when I check. Last I checked it was $1.76ish.The price has tanked over the last 24 hours after steady rises over the last week, what is going on!? Shocked to see it drop so quick."
3424,Mid,iconomi,"I get that too. The price is updated but the last graph update is at 1.96xxx. I've seen that before as well. "
3425,Mid,iconomi,"hi, what app do you use? I am searching for some but cant find. Now ckecking it by chrome browser.."
3426,Mid,iconomi,Also sometimes the app signs me out completely and I have to input my email / pw again. Basically it can be buggy it seems. 
3427,Mid,iconomi,Gracias :)
3428,Mid,iconomi,"I don't know. It is still for sale, I bought some, but I  am underwater right now with the dip. "
3429,Mid,iconomi,Thanks. Perhaps you're right. Sometimes the price shows $0.00 for me too.
3430,Mid,iconomi,"No mine is showing correctly 1.77 ishPerhaps your phone and account is fucked. "
3431,Mid,iconomi,"no can't find BLX on blockfolio, only icn."
3432,Mid,iconomi,It is now cheaper on iconomi.net

3439,Mid,iconomi,"It does effect the price on exchanges because people wonŒÇt sell there at a loss and pull their orders higher.The BLX token itself is nothing more than a kind of coupon to claim back the assets that were once used to buy it on the platform.It shouldnŒÇt matter where you buy it"
3440,Mid,iconomi,"Is there a way for CMC to determine the total amount of BLX? Doesnt't the  tracker address only show the amount of BLX that is moved off the ICN platform? If CMC can't see the total amount of BLX, I imagine listing the token would not be very useful."

3454,Mid,iconomi,I did it as i said but it would be probably better if team makes an official request too.
3455,Mid,iconomi,Blockfolio and CoinCap 
3456,Mid,iconomi,BLX added to blockfolio would also brighten my day.
3457,Mid,iconomi,"That's the exact point of  BLX minimised risks and still a decent gain. I think it is worth investing at least 50% of your assets to BLX because of the smaller risks, you can play around with the other half. "
3458,Mid,iconomi,"Yes, it will be interesting to see. Blockchain.ONE, and adding fiat deposit to the platform might be huge."
3459,Mid,iconomi,"I took that to mean that ICONOMI is trying not to cause noticeable spikes. Buybacks definitely have the potential to increase the price, but it depends completely on how large the fees and icnp profits end up looking like. To date the buybacks have had a theoretical impact of something like ~0.0000067 ETH per ICN, which is negligible next to the huge swings from speculation. I think the next few quarterly reports will really clarify the buyback situation."
3460,Mid,iconomi,"20k/year? Bullshit, maybe 20 years ago"
3461,Mid,iconomi,And one week later Binance has bigger ICN/ETH volume than Kraken... Got patience much?
3462,Mid,iconomi,"Unfortunately I only know of the way I described in my post on how to get BLX data. So to get live data you have to use the websocket of Iconomi, which will require some programming though, since I do not think OpenOffice can read websocket data."
3463,Mid,iconomi,"$10 ICN but $20,000 BTC, joke's on everyone."
3464,Mid,iconomi,"How do you know they don't market correctly (source, please, if you can)? Because you are not targeted? I am just speculating now, but do you think they would spend money attracting small fish like you and me at this point, or trying to reach out to the whales in the fiat world? Don't forget about the Blockchain.ONE fund. I believe this will be huge."
3465,Mid,iconomi,Guess so. Debt used correctly is also the only way to stay on top of inflation. Stupid fractional reserve fiat currency system. I'm so hyped about crypto for this reason.
3466,Mid,iconomi,"You say ""current price"".And Tim M. Zagar says this: ""ICN tokens will be repurchased at a price that does not exceed the highest independent bid or the last quoted transaction price. This should not inflate the market price and rather serves as a price support.Purchase volume should never reach more than 20% of total ICN volume traded in the last 24 hours.""Source: https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-introduces-repayment-programme-54bfa449d458Does this mean that the buybacks won't increase the price, only serve as support and liquidity?"
3467,Mid,iconomi,"You would have made 7x when the best performer (Monero) made 3x? Sorry, usually just ignores FUD, but somebody has to say this. Gains don't accumulate. If bitcoin rises 2x and eth 3x, you don't make 5x. Please, educate yourself.BLX is great and I wish I knew about it from the start (beta). The little extra I have made investing on my own compared to the  BLX gains, doesn't make it worth it compared to how much of my spare time I have spent chasing the biggest gains. Imagine being able to just invest in a tracker controlled by experts and ride the bull wave with minimum efforts..."
3468,Mid,iconomi,Debt used correctly is a wonderous thing. 
3469,Mid,iconomi,But not so many bears. 
3470,Mid,iconomi,That's a good point!
3471,Mid,iconomi,"So nows the time to scoop up some ICN, I for one hate using these poxy exchanges and GDAX doesn't offer a realistic buying perspective on all coins.."
3472,Mid,iconomi,In that case I cant wait! But depends on how much ICN will it cost me to make and then edit one obviously.
3473,Mid,iconomi,"It probably would have but also you probably wouldn't have done that. Ethereum from march is at 20x growth, where BLX is at 10x growth. It's a split risk fund, with all types of projects. One thing you will notice though. When Ethereum dropped 50/60% in a day, BLX didn't. It dropped 35%. Thus the split risk. "
3474,Mid,iconomi,"It's a managed fund, and is invested in all coins at the same time. Some go up, some go down. It seems, what you're after is a DAA, a custom portfolio with all the coins YOU like. This will be out shortly and will give you move options than just BLX. "
3475,Mid,iconomi,Then you will probably have to contact them manually to get your stuff out
3476,Mid,iconomi,There is very little volume and therefore price can fluctuate a lot. 
3477,Mid,iconomi,"Yes when I bought ICNX, ETH was about 200$ because I remember that my iconomi profile was showing cca 1000$ value (I sent 5 ETH there). I think what is confusing me is that while only ETH on its own got 2x gains since, the value of the whole tracker went up 2x as well. If had split my investment between BTC, ETH and XMR I would have made 7x. And that is the confusing part - if I invested in stocks individually picked, I would never make as much as investing into a tracker unless  I made some really really lucky picks. Here we are talking about 3 from the top 10 crypto... Like if I invested in Google, FB and Amazon.  I'm just getting a feeling that it is a bit early days of this stuff in crypto as it is very unlikely that one of these assets will go down on it's own - it will either completely burts or all of it will go up. But we have to start somewhere and it will be interesting to see where will this go. Either way buying BTC, ETH and XMR on my own would net me 3.5x higher return. Again, correct me if I'm wrong.  EDIT: sorry what I wrote above is wrong - if I invested 100$ in BTC, 100$ in ETH and 100$ XMR I would have ended up with 700$ which is 2.5x not 7x. So due to weighting the overall gain from BLX is probably somewhere in 2x field. It was just hard to accept in simpleton's logic."
3478,Mid,iconomi,"By yesterday they should have bought back and burned 669 ETH worth of ICN total over the history of ICN. That means you would have gotten about 0.0000067 ETH per ICN if there were dividends. At this time that is about $1 for every 400 ICN you own. Before gas fees.Buybacks will work fine, they're not moving the price yet because the platform has only been public for a month, buybacks for the month the platform has been open haven't even started yet, and the core value proposition of the platform(DAA management) hasn't even launched yet.Some of you guys could use to simmer down and come back at the end of the month when the Q3 report comes out.

3483,Mid,iconomi,It wont work. During verification passport is checked and not a residency documents.
3484,Mid,iconomi,"The reason you're not seeing huge gains against ETH is because ETH went up a lot in that time as well. I would need the date of when you bought the ICNX to show you exact numbers but ETH in July went as low as 149 and a lot of the month was spent below 200. So while bitcoin went 1.5x and Monero went 3x ETH also went something like 2x.When you're doing comparisons like this you should try to stick to one reference currency, I think you may be confusing yourself. In reference to dollars you made something like a 100% gain, in reference to ETH you made a 4% gain because during the same time ETH made a 96% gain in reference to dollars(numbers are guesstimates to illustrate the point). Hope this helps."
3485,Mid,iconomi,BLX is called dispersion. It is happening in good and in bad times. It is passive investment. Everybody who know to predict prices would be smarter to buy tokens directly.

3500,Mid,iconomi,$20 really.
3501,Mid,iconomi,CMC would be great! AFAIK it would be very easy to get it listed on there and it would be a ton of exposure. Things like circulating supply might be difficult to keep updated but I have no idea. Also market cap doesn't make much sense in relation to BLX.
3502,Mid,iconomi,Price oracles are hard when trading is spotty. Hopefully other exchanges will list it soon!

3515,Mid,iconomi,That doesn't make sense?
3516,Mid,iconomi,What purpose do mco tokens have
3517,Mid,iconomi,In a few weeks or possible months. Hundreds of people will require ICN to create their custom DAAs. That is the purpose. All you need is just a slight demand - compared with the buyback. I is or will be a great token to hold.

What you ought to be doing now is calculating how much ICN will need to be consumed for you to find the current price acceptable.

3539,Mid,iconomi,"I don't understand? someone please translate"
3540,Mid,iconomi,It is going to shoot when they confirm it's purpose. Stack up guys!
3541,Mid,iconomi,You will see in Q3. I will buy you a beer if this is not true.
3542,Mid,iconomi,"Do you realy think that ICONOMI team who has 13 mio ICN tokens wont have interest to made ICN token as usable as possible. If you will wait with investment till everything is clear you will miss all  profits.This is crypto not some store where you can buy old well  known products."
3543,Mid,iconomi,In my opinion they could communicate far better their product. They may have hired some fancy PR agency but still. Why for example they don't have any videos on their home page explaining Iconomi. It's a small investment that could mean a lot. With their budget they could do far better.
3544,Mid,iconomi,"Then again you ""think the entire crypto community are slowly starting to see the ICN 'investors' as the novice crowd"" like a great crypto overseer you seem to be.Edit: over and out, if you are in the same boat as me GL if not - see you around. "
3545,Mid,iconomi,Not cheering....just cautiously optimistic. :)
3546,Mid,iconomi,"exactly, like what..the..fuck.. it went down like a rocket!"
3547,Mid,iconomi,Buy in was at 1$ so x10 is easy
3548,Mid,iconomi,Lesson number 1 with icn never cheer too early
3549,Mid,iconomi,"When did I say I thought that? I did not, you just decided to interpret me as saying that, wrongly. "
3550,Mid,iconomi,"If you think that majority of *any* ICO investors are anything else than novice investors, think again. Concerning token usage - some is known and some will be known. But thanks for reminding me, I was wrong. "
3551,Mid,iconomi,"I think we can reach it after 2017 report, somewhere at start of 2018."
3552,Mid,iconomi,Shill - but still agree.
3553,Mid,iconomi,It was only a matter of time.
3554,Mid,iconomi,"Well obviously you are wrong, not everyone knows, as people keep spewing the same nonsense about ICN having a clear purpose currently. And then you have those who argue the indefensible, arguing against currently known facts, it's quite remarkable. I think the entire crypto community are slowly starting to see the ICN 'investors' as the novice crowd, quite rightly so to be honest. "
3555,Mid,iconomi,"Yes, everybody is aware of that. You are saying it in every thread. Look, we know that, ok? Really. Clarification is coming in the upcoming months or weeks and you cannot speed it up. "
3556,Mid,iconomi,"Right, but unless the quantities of ICN required to do so are released, then no one is able to evaluate whether that purpose is sufficient For example if one ICN is required then ICN is effectively worthless "
3557,Mid,iconomi,The Iconomi team seems to indicate that ICN will be required to set up DAA funds.

3567,Mid,iconomi,"The fund was established in July 2016 I believe, so it's a little over a year old. It recently rebranded to BLX from its original name of ICNX and only recently has it been this open to new investors."

3569,Mid,iconomi,"Except, if no purpose is assigned to ICN, then there will be no demand for the token, something you still don't quite seem to grasp."

3571,Mid,iconomi,"Check it now, still down? _ôÖŠ"
3572,Mid,iconomi,"So what is the purpose of ICN then?  It appears that you know what no one else in the world even knows, not even the Iconomi team, so please enlighten us..."
3573,Mid,iconomi,It got renamed recently but the fund originally launched back in late December.  It's closer to 9 months old than 6.
3574,Mid,iconomi,Yet they haven't assigned ICN a specific purpose yet......a question which has gone unanswered since the ICO...

3584,Mid,iconomi,In my opinion Iconomi team just does not know how to market their platform correcty. We need to wait for them to hire some real marketing experts to do that. But ofcourse they need to finish the product first. So just relax by the end of the year everything will come together.

I just don't understand what there is to talk about. The team has communicated, on numerous occasions, that there will be a use. And that specifics will be announced at full launch in a few months. So for many, that answer is not satisfactory. That's fine. So...why keep beating a dead horse?"
3590,Mid,iconomi,thats ~ .005 ETH at current prices. (390)
3591,Mid,iconomi,"Thats funny, i just made a post about this. Glad others are aware of it. Please Please please, some folks that are outside of the US, get some volume up on there. People wanna buy."

3593,Mid,iconomi,Tell me just 3 cheaper tokens and 5 reasons why they are undervalued.
3594,Mid,iconomi,It is small exchange but there were days when some pair had 2mio$ daily volume.
3595,Mid,iconomi,"It was in closed beta, and slowly opened up to ICO participants before the public launch last monthEdit: it was recently renamed from icnx"
3596,Mid,iconomi,hell yes!  finally!  BLX will be a massive hit!
3597,Mid,iconomi,"Sorry, who is lame in this story?"
3598,Mid,iconomi,"The buyback model already in other projects and it will be even more common in future.Here some examples (just the first page of Google results ""crypto buybacks"")https://zrcoin.io/https://obits.io/http://www.quantumproject.org/https://www.everex.io/https://betking.io/I think Monaco and Bcap have a smiliar model but could be wrongIt doesnŒÇt matter who creates the demand of the coins and I even think buy&burn is the better alternative to buy&sell like plain utility tokens would have. A slowdown of the usage of a utility token platform would bring everything back on the market again whereas burning tokens changes the market with every day irreversibly.If thatŒÇs not a reason to buy ICN before the announcement of the additional utility features you need to wait till after they announce it"
3599,Mid,iconomi,"How long has the BLX existed for ?    I thought this was a rather new thing. Not 6 moths of history."
3600,Mid,iconomi,Yes.
3601,Mid,iconomi,"You can put an expiration ""date"" on it. It will cancel the order after a certain number of blocks."
3602,Mid,iconomi,So technically anyone (non-us residents) can buy it in Iconomi and sell it etherdelta at a higher price?
3603,Mid,iconomi,"Is this not useful?https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/6vewtu/blx_chart_01012017_22082017/I noticed you've seen it before, though."
3604,Mid,iconomi,You can buy all the BLX coins and keep them in your ~~ICONOMI~~ COINOMI wallet without management or exit fees. Monthly rebalancing is possible via ShapeShift integration. And you don't need to do the IDnow video verification.
3605,Mid,iconomi,EtherDelta is a playground for silly valuations. Don't be surprised to see fractional orders placed for ridiculous prices (e.g. someone making 1 BLX appear to be worth thousands of dollars)
3606,Mid,iconomi,"I like your theory, but ICN isn't one of the cheapest. It's quite high up on the list."
3607,Mid,iconomi,"You are not our jani8x  We are not stranded."
3608,Mid,iconomi,I was about jump in.. but wow $1000 limit? Not the best limit going around. Hopefully we get a response or an option to upgrade soon
3609,Mid,iconomi,"Yes it's an opportunity but it's on really low volume and there are very few buyers on EtherDelta at the minute.. so overall, probably not worth doing it but I'm someone will pick up a few $$ if they're patient enough."
3610,Mid,iconomi,As I have explained above.
3611,Mid,iconomi,"The other way around, I know it's the US laws, but what? Do they forbid internet trading or something? "
3612,Mid,iconomi,Sorry my friend. If you still dont understand the point of ICN nowbody on the world can help you. I would you recomend ONE COIN it is realy good oportunity ;)
3613,Mid,iconomi,"That still doesn't answer the golden question, what is the purpose of ICN and why should someone bother buying it ... "
3614,Mid,iconomi,I am still confused. So can we withdraw more than $1000 worth ICNX or BLX to wallet ? Please let me know TIA
3615,Mid,iconomi,Not good for us in the us!
3616,Mid,iconomi,"If BLX grows further and the seller forgets his orders, it might be a cheap buy soon :P"
3617,Mid,iconomi,"They added BLX to cryptocompare, the price is wrong."
3618,Mid,iconomi,that post was referring to a previous post + i think the question was pretty implicit (whats going on with the tokens?): dont you think so?
3619,Mid,iconomi,"Dear govdo, reread your previous post and you will find that there are 0 questions asked. Prepare your question for upcoming AMA and we will answer it among other questions."
3620,Mid,iconomi,This is fantastic arbitrageurs can create blx tokens at $1.97 and sell for $3.12. This will cause money to pour into the platform.
3621,Mid,iconomi,"is this somehow correlated to iconomi also transfering their ""vested"" tokens to their platform?https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/6xf3bk/iconomi_starting_to_censor_again_deleted_post/ as you can see I'm pretty pissed at them deleting my posts just because i raised a simple concern.You seem to be more active on their slack than they do themselves so maybe you could give us an answer?I know its not your job or company to reply to this question but it would be nice to have an answer from someone....Thanks"
3622,Mid,iconomi,Can someone explain this?
3623,Mid,iconomi,"Reminder - BLX price isn't dictated by buy / sell orders on any exchange. In order to pay a 'fair' price, you need to look at price of BLX on Iconomi's website and convert it to ETH....For example ETH is currently $392. BLX is $1.97. Cheapest you can buy BLX on EtherDelta is .00796ETH which is about $3.12.So obviously it's not a smart buy and you're paying a hefty premium for it."
3624,Mid,iconomi,explains the small surge :)
3625,Mid,iconomi,"Sure they can, but at 5% premium or so on Etherdelta. "
3626,Mid,iconomi,"i was holding icn since 15min ago (from ico) and the price stagnation didnt make me sell but being treated like this did it - this is outrageous! what is eaven more outrageous is that the post will be downvoted by the community because i insulted their iconomi gods. If the team drasticaly changes direction in communication i will probably buy icn again because it is possibly one of the best projects in crypto but until they keep treating us like cattle im not touching this one with a 4 foot pole. good luck everyone"

3630,Mid,iconomi,Problem is I'm down 10% and I don't want to just sell at a lose as I hope ICN will grow... but a part of me is looking at BLX like it would be better. The joys of investing eh _ôÖ‰
3631,Mid,iconomi,Thanks _ô»_ôé 
3632,Mid,iconomi,"It was us.As part of our portfolio diversification and risk management strategy we sold 10,000 ETH for fiat a while back and are now buying BLX for 10,000 ETH.We saw the amount of effort ICONOMI put into designing a bulletproof system. We investigated all the alternatives thoroughly after the Parity multisig fiasco and we believe that the ICONOMI platform is the safest place for our tokens."
3633,Mid,iconomi,BLX is great if you want to decrease the risk of investing in cryptos as the risk is spread between different assets. And if you're like me who works full time and doesn't have time to follow the crypto world so closely then BLX is good as it's actively managed by people who do it as their full time job. You should of course make your own research and decicions but putting some of your ICN holdings to BLX could ease your mind and reduce your investment risk.
3634,Mid,iconomi,I suggest reading the top pinned thread by Daparski. You find all the relevant/available information there. More concerning DAAs is expected in the coming month.
3635,Mid,iconomi,"The 3% yearly fee does not touch the number of BLX tokens you hold. Instead, the number of BTC and the other assets represented by each BLX is reduced by 3% each year, or more accurately 0.002% every 6 hours."
3636,Mid,iconomi,"Do you own any BLX already? If not, then why not sell *some* ICN and get some BLX too.If you're currently below the price you bought ICN at, then you have to decide if it's worth it for you to do this.If you do split it, and ICN ends up out-performing BLX, don't kick yourself. You'll still benefit from the gains in both."
3637,Mid,iconomi,"Yep, assuming you dont already have all your funds in."
3638,Mid,iconomi,I believe it already calculated. 
3639,Mid,iconomi,you should point that to the US laws from the 60's and not to crypto.
3640,Mid,iconomi,what a buying opportunity then though.
3641,Mid,iconomi,"And ICN is a very, very different investment than BLX. BLX is designed to work as many funds are, insulating investors from having to make daily decisions and understand/manage the risk of working with individual assets. ICN is one of those assets you have to work at to understand and manage the risk.Figure out where you are on the spectrum of investors and invest in a way that matches your commitment to investing."
3642,Mid,iconomi,Easy with such a bullish market. I'll see you when the inevitable pop happens.
3643,Mid,iconomi,It's the other way around.
3644,Mid,iconomi,Keep them and buy blx
3645,Mid,iconomi,"correct, but I'm not sure if they are included in the calculated value shown "
3646,Mid,iconomi,what's the point with banning US in crypto- world?  
3647,Mid,iconomi,I'm not listening normally :-) thanks for the advice. 
3648,Mid,iconomi,So lame that US customers cannot get in on this :(
3649,Mid,iconomi,In future youŒÇll see more and more other crypto projects that use buybacks to distribute their profits. I would advice to inform yourself to understand the potential of it before listening to fud
3650,Mid,iconomi,"Yeah, it's a no-brainer if you're willing to take the slightly higher risk. There's so much more money coming in the crypto space before the thing turns into a big fat bubble."
3651,Mid,iconomi,"Australian here, also interested in when we will be able to upgrade to Tier 2. "
3652,Mid,iconomi,Thanks guys most appreciated. _ô»_ôé
3653,Mid,iconomi,"I kept asking myself the same and decided to keep buying and hodling ICN, because :* it is been stated clearly what the role of the token will be (see sticky)* I have a feeling there will be more than what is confirmed at the moment* The deflationary model alone makes it a good long long term investment* somehow it's immune to the success of the market and thus things like BLX. I mean, if people all start to dump their BLX out of panic, fees will still be made and thus profit for the ICN token* BLX is only one fund, many more will be made, for which ICN is needed* ICN is on sale right now with all this FUDBLX however is great for people not wanting to manage their own portfolio.I actually like how ICN is not in the spotlight anymore.

3654,Mid,iconomi,Keep it man it's going back up. They're going to announce specifics on usage soon also
3655,Mid,iconomi,"They are deducted every 6 hours ( 3%/365*4=0.002%).So every 6 hours 0.002% are deducted which makes 3% per year.(Correct me if im wrong)"

3657,Mid,iconomi,"I like the idea of holding INC for a certain amount of time to create a DAA and for other functions.Also holding ICN as a collateral for credit/loan, something like SALT are doing. I have no idea how difficult this is from the legal point of view, but something worth considering.I'm liking these ideas and there shouldn't be any problem finding uses for the token. "
3658,Mid,iconomi,i am. as of 5 mins. ago. started small with 0.96 Eth
3659,Mid,iconomi,"Hi, first time comment on here. Long time lurker...I thought I wouldComment as liked the thread idea. I was thinking of commenting on any additional functions myself just in case team we're reading (although I'm sure they have better ideas than me!)First off to put my cards on the table I do have a reasonable holding of icn with other various coins. I am a big supporter of the team and the project... so despite recent comments on here which I think at times can go a bit overboard, want to say a big thanks to Jani and the team...I agree with some of these additional functions of the coin.Similar to your idea; I thought having x amount of icn held on the iconomi site should give you access to the blx distribution and rebalancing (which is currently public) but in my opinion very useful Info for anyone thinking about investing in any coin in general... particularly if a very significant amount of money is now being invested into the fund (in the future I imagine this will only go up).... I am not suggesting that iconomi money would completely inflate or deflate a coin, but I do think that in reasonable sums of money are coming into the fund this would provide people with further confidence to invest in the coin/crypto they were thinking about adding into their fund. With a reasonably updated Indicator of money flowing into the blx fund (doesn't have to be daily). Perhaps in the future a 2x icn holding on the iconomi site would give you all data for the various daa's and again money flow into each particular cryptocurrency. Which in turn would be very useful info for traders and also daa managers. The access is lost if you reduce icn below x amount... just an idea in addition to the previous mentioned (similar to what you have said to be fair).Of course this information might be hard to update continually (and I am certainly no tech savvy/ regulations person to Know if his was even feasible) but something along those lines in addition to previous utilities may give a further incentive for people to hold the coin on iconomi.... just an idea?"
3660,Mid,iconomi,"hmmm actually yes it seems like they've transferred 207m CFI on to the Iconomi platform...207m CFI (worth about $51m) went from that address to this one: https://etherscan.io/token/Cofound?a=0x2a068aac312acc5f4996be9d1ab810a8b6223c76 which is owned by Iconomi...So it would appear that there's been a major partnership of some kind between Cofound.it /Iconomi. They've always been closely linked of course but Cofound.it have transferred about $51m CFI and $3.9m ETH in to Iconomi owned addresses over the past 24 hours..."
3661,Mid,iconomi,This information also seem to be required to get BLX on exchanges like EtherDelta https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6x5uz0/please_add_the_iconomi_blockchain_index_blx_to/
3662,Mid,iconomi,If I had that kind of money I'd do it too
3663,Mid,iconomi,It seems they have also transfered their CFI tokens now
3664,Mid,iconomi,"it is really crazy, everyday it is UP! Everyday I have more money in my bank because it's already .1 more than yesterday.. If I had more money it would be in.."
3665,Mid,iconomi,"It looks like that deposit was made by Cofound.it. It came from this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x67faa7a9700f22e7c88cf7e099e58baf59a45fbbWhich holds 26.7k ETH, 1.9m CFI tokens and received 209m CFI back from white hat multisig exploit. My guess is they're diversifying rather than staying all in ETH (probably a smart move) whilst simultaneously supporting Iconomi who they have very close links with.There's also been another 500ETH + 100ETH deposited to BLX a few hours ago too from other addresses.

3674,Mid,iconomi,I'm up 210% on my tier 1 investment since getting in when ETH was $200 (it has basically outperformed ETH and BTC over the same period). Just increased my holdings after recently getting tier 2 verified. 
3675,Mid,iconomi,The returns will attract traditional investors in droves . For what icnx returned last month would take most brokers 20 months to achieve!!!
3676,Mid,iconomi,Hope ICN rises 
3677,Mid,iconomi,my opinion about the FUD and price of the ICN token is that it will wear out in about a week when everyone forgets about the coin. It will stabilize around  0.00045 for about a week then start to slowly recover.
3678,Mid,iconomi,I don't think he was being sarcastic.
3679,Mid,iconomi,He was being sarcastic. ICN has had a bit of a rough ride. 
3680,Mid,iconomi,"> werent the vested tokens beeing kept by a third party kind of escrow?Possibly. More info would be nice either way. At the moment, it appears they have the ability to move them where they want. For example, would this escrow be approving the move onto the platform? Who controls the account they were moved to? There's far too much trust expected around here. It's quite an arrogant way to treat investors. The feeling is like ""have faith and ye shall be rewarded""... this is supposed to be a business, not a religion :-PThe community is a mixed bag. There's a lot of reasonable voices. It used to be a lot worse in terms of people crying ""FUD"". I think the worst ones are in the minority now."

3683,Mid,iconomi,What do you mean?
3684,Mid,iconomi,"Hopefully the team will put the 13 million into view, so we can actually see the ""vesting"" take place.I'm not really bothered if they want to sell some - though it might look bad if they sell while everyone is questioning the value. The main thing I worry about is that there's currently no system in place to hold them to this ""vesting"" thing. They still have full access to every token, so what was all that vesting talk about?"

3694,Mid,iconomi,Blackmoon is going to blow this dead horse out of the water. And guess what? The token has REAL utility. Most all the criticisms I read here were baseless and begrudgingly written by bagholders. RemindMe! 180 days
3695,Mid,iconomi,"What ever they choose, it'll be a smart regulated move, too many strong legal (and other) members on their team for it to not be above board.I for one believe that BLX will be listed on LSE or something similar, and DAA integration in the next month (if expected by end of sept) will see all our questions answered. FYI - BLX on LSE I can really really see."
3696,Mid,iconomi,"They said that you will need to burn a certain amount of ICN to create a DAA (and maybe perform some actions on it) which is ok but by having a mandatory small % amount in the DAA pfolio would mean that the more people (and so directly money) the DAA (and in global the platform) is getting, so the more money the Iconomi company is making - the more money we are directly making.I think taht would make our profits much much more directly correlated with the gains the company is making.Well maybe by combinating the ICN platform utility you are speaking about + minimum % ICN in array would make for a good hybrid solution because that would give the token utility and also make it look more like a share in the company.I think the problem here is again that by making it so much alike to a share maybe that could cause conflicts with regulators.....they have to walk a very very thin line between the token being a security and/or utility - so they dont make investors angry and they dont make regulators possibly angry....not at all an easy job!"
3697,Mid,iconomi,"Great! Now, AUM is the sum of the market caps of the cryptos included on the index? Or the amount of money people have spent buying BLX tokens? Or something else?"
3698,Mid,iconomi,"Get used to it. There's quite a few people on this sub who are so pathetic that they downvote anything like this. I'm guessing they are noob investors who are emotionally attached to this token.Iconomi could dump the entire 13 million, and you'd see these people make excuses for them. I just find it laughable. Worthy of mockery."
3699,Mid,iconomi,"Money will flow out of crypto altogether id think. I wouldn't consider BCC as a safe haven.- But I could be wrong!"

3701,Mid,iconomi,Lol
3702,Mid,iconomi,"Totally #diversifed, ditch bitcoin cash tho "

3710,Mid,iconomi,"I think the team have already agreed on the DAA usage and it has been mentioned in the last 2 AMA's that the ICN token is required to maintain and create DAA's.Therefore, as DAA's are being released soon, this is when I expect ICN utility to be expressed and a part of the platform. Something similar to your idea might be implemented, but simply holding ICN doesn't create value unless it's being used/burned."
3711,Mid,iconomi,"That is weird, 13 million were the remaining tokens that were not sold on the ICO. ""Of the remaining 13 million tokens, 2 million were distributed to advisors, 8 million were distributed to the ICONOMI team, and 3 million were reserved for future team members.

3720,Mid,iconomi,"I'm surprised he wasn't able to at least find out about buybacks, especially as he's on Daparski's newbie guide, where it's explained in detail.I agree the value isn't solidified yet, but his research is a bit shit.It's rare to find a crypto youtuber who fully understands the subject they're talking about.

3722,Mid,iconomi,"As of now there's over $7m in the BLX ETH address and it's only been public for a month with little to no marketing and a lot of people still waiting on T2 verification. So it's $213k/year in management fees at current rates. At this rate, BLX management fees alone will cover running costs of the business and as Jani said that's unheard of for most startups, even crypto startups... The reality is that while most of these crypto startups are sitting on huge amounts of ETH / crypto, they'll slowly burn through it as they try to deliver on their plan. So it's a great sign that Iconomi is already showing that it can fend for itself without having to rely on its crypto reserves. "
3723,Mid,iconomi,"Likely a coincidence. I thought if that was the case, it would help others get verified more quickly. "
3724,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think so, but they're quickly catching up on the backlog "
3725,Mid,iconomi,"Just so you know, they've already confirmed that they won't be releasing a new whitepaper. It was in a previous AMA."
3726,Mid,iconomi,"Im very optimistic about ICONOMI too, both ICN (top wallets) and BLX (invested also there).But I think Jani's reply yesterday, even though aimed at communicating good news, was the kind of reply a bully can give when showing off with a stupid girl. It was definitely not the kind of communication that happens between investors and a serious company, why such an update can't be done with an official post? I guess there are various interesting news like that one every month.If ICONOMI communicates with the community in a different way (different from wasting time creating hype) the fud situation would be much different, and both investors confidence and the price would rise as it happens with all the random coins out there.I personally don't care if Jani feels he's a big boy because the company is doing well, as an investor I care about updates (again, different from hype)The Warren Buffet quote too, Jesus Christ"
3727,Mid,iconomi,"Thank you , I'm of the same view as you . "
3728,Mid,iconomi,I agree but they can't wait until December to make the announcement. 
3729,Mid,iconomi,To me first rise in value would be the announcement of this month/quarter revenue. And the second and significant rise would be the announcement of ICN token usage. This might come approx to the end of the year.
3730,Mid,iconomi,"True. Instead I would point to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/6rkx1l/new_to_iconomi_start_here/) which does a far better job of explaining things than what I've written, the outdated whitepaper and the help centre."
3731,Mid,iconomi,"Agreed. I think the management team have a big picture idea, but they're still discovering and experimenting with ways to achieve that vision. I'm cool with that kind of innovation."
3732,Mid,iconomi,I agree but what do you envisaged medium term to be ?  
3733,Mid,iconomi,^ this 
3734,Mid,iconomi,"Thanks for pointing out that the white paper needs updating. I agree.Yes, I hold the same position because:- the token represents the ability to vote for a new management team after the current management period ends which if I remember correctly is two years- the current management team have vested interest in the ICN token's value as they own a significant percentage of the tokens- the token represents value in the assets owned by Iconomi, assets raised during the ICO that have since increased in value, but I think we're navigating through precarious legal waters here. Even suggesting that ICN represents a share in the company which were offered publicly for sale is a big legal no no.- utility wise, the token is required to make use of several features (creating a new DAA, BLX management fees, performance fees) within the platform- upcoming features like the debit card and fiat gateway may increase value of the token if the token is required for usage of these featuresOverall I do agree that communications could be improved and outdated information updated. The Iconomi website and help center needs a make over and so on. All of these (as an early investor) I'm cool with because I understand that we're not in a marketing drive right now. We don't really needs lots of new interest in the ICN token or unnatural sudden price increases of it, instead the focus should continue with developing the core product, services and outstanding features.If all us who own ICN feel and act as part of one ecosystem and worked towards the improvement of this ecosystem, I must result in some kind of gain for everyone involved, regardless of whether you came in during the ICO or at the highest price point the token reached."
3735,Mid,iconomi,Well said. I agree on this and am very optimistic about ICN tokens in near future.

3740,Mid,iconomi,ok thank you for your answer !
3741,Mid,iconomi,Remember that past performance don't guarantee the future performance. Investment risk is the chance that you will receive less than the expected return from an investment.
3742,Mid,iconomi,"You can buy BLX and hope the the bull run continues. Or, you cna buy the ICN dip and hope it recovers losses."
3743,Mid,iconomi,"Yes it is the same, but in Yobit the prices are always wrong. I wouldn't trust them selling it for .000000125 each."
3744,Mid,iconomi,"Buy all the BLX you can, sell when ICN looks like it's going up, otherwise it just sits there. You can buy more ICN that way"
3745,Mid,iconomi," I would BLX is doing very very well. $0 - nearly $2 in a month. And consistent! "
3746,Mid,iconomi,"First question: Yes, that's how it works, except that currently the fiat onramp is not live, so you will have to buy with ETH (recommend it over BTC due to transaction times). For the 20% per week, we are currently in a bull market, but that figure *will* change in the future. Nobody knows when though."

3748,Mid,iconomi,If more people have access to buy it wouldn't the price increase?
3749,Mid,iconomi,"Terrifying. Though it's not totally retroactive, they have been clear that it would have utility re: DAAs, and, of course, the main function is buybacks. "
3750,Mid,iconomi,"The problem is that this is crypto... not the stock market. Without a utility, nobody wants your token. It's too big a risk, when your only explanation for buying it is that Iconomi will buy it back. The theory might be that this knowledge will cause the market to react positively, but that's just a theory - and not one worth betting on, with so many other options out there.That's what he knows, that you don't. Quite a few of us have understood this for a long time, and remain baffled by those who do not.I've kind of taken a back seat on this issue, because a utility will be made more clear eventually - but the way Iconomi have handled this has been terrible so far."
3751,Mid,iconomi,I think that up until now the buybacks have been relatively insignificant or at least dwarfed by speculation and that is making lots of people anxious. When Q3 and Q4 reports come around and we see what things are like when the platform has been open for a while that will give a far better understanding of the impact of the buyback structure. I am very optimistic.
3752,Mid,iconomi,"From The New To Iconomi post, ""Buybacks (Repayment program): buybacks are made on a weekly base and always performed on open markets (no OTC deals). Buyback orders will always be below the highest bid and will not surpass 20% of the trading volume in the last 24 hours. This way profits generated by Iconomi will serve as a constant price support, rather than artificially increasing the token value through market buys.""It will have some impact, but I'm assuming that they post a buy order of less than the highest bid for a size of no more than 20% of the trade volume.  If buybacks are weekly, there should be 13 (52/4) of them each quarter.  So divide the buyback amount by 13 and spread it across the different trading pairs.  It's not going to move things that much but there will occasionally be a fat order for several thousand ICN that isn't going to spoof away.  In the future, this order could be a buy wall representing close to 20% of the daily volume and could well support the price unless people have reason to panic sell into it."
3753,Mid,iconomi,I believe they didn't have an use for it before.
3754,Mid,iconomi,It is concerning. I am glad the team's tokens are vested for 2 years (starting 1 year ago). It is in their best interest to have the price go up - at least for next year so they can cash out nicely.
3755,Mid,iconomi,Well said.
3756,Mid,iconomi,Isn't it slightly concerning that they're trying to retroactively fit the token into the product? 
3757,Mid,iconomi,Going on sale you mean xD
3758,Mid,iconomi,So the price will plummet 20% again? 
3759,Mid,iconomi,"same here, i cashed out when they changed the dividen model to burning. I wish I hadn't :("
3760,Mid,iconomi,"Do you have the numbers? I remember reading that they spread out the buys to avoid spiking the price which makes sense. But I don't see how they can avoid moving the price by choice, if they're obligated to buy a certain amount of ICN depending on the fee based income. It's gonna have an impact on the price nomatter how they buy. Or do you know something I don't?"
3761,Mid,iconomi,"Jani said they were testing out scenarios to make the ICN token useful, so we gotta wait for their word.On a side note, probably not a bad idea to throw some spare change into mln."
3762,Mid,iconomi,"Agreed.  This is what I'm interested in, not the coin.  As an investment platform, this looks great.  I've just done tier 2 with a lovely man named Patrick."
3763,Mid,iconomi,exactly
3764,Mid,iconomi,"The buyback policy is structured to move the price as little as possible and is more likely to present a support floor than anything else.  There is a small amount of value added by buybacks decreasing ICN relative to book value but it will be awhile before that's significant.Positive price discovery around utility is required for the value to run.*If everyone acts in good faith and markets are somewhat rational."
3765,Mid,iconomi,"But their purpose *is* vaguely confirmed. It will indirectly cost ICN to open DAA's and even buying and selling BLX on traditional exchanges will results in ICN being used on the platform. It has also been confirmed by the team that they will keep burning them based on the profit.I'll pick up some BLX just because we are so early, but I keep believing that ICN is the best long long term bet as it's immune to the success or failure of the market in general and thus also BLX. As long as people keep using the platform, we're good. "
3766,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think you're understanding how investing works, currently ICN has no purpose and it does not represent a share in a company, do you believe that to be a good investment? How exactly will buybacks sustain the price in the future if no purpose for the token is issued, where would new buyers come from? Nowhere because they would be buying what is effectively nothing.  There would be a mass sell off and a one sided market, people would drop ICN faster than a hot potato.And you are seriously saying that you don't understand why ICN needs another value source other than buybacks? If the value is is only driven from buybacks then the demand comes only from a single source that is the Iconomi. You don't see the issue with that long term? Please read the extensive discussions on the subject in this thread by myself and others discussing that exact issue:- https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/6rkx1l/new_to_iconomi_start_here/The buybacks are currently a way for Iconomi to buy back what is effectively the fresh air you have purchased from them.  If you believe this is a good deal then I have some sheets of paper with magical properties I will sell to you, I promise I will buy it back from you..."
3767,Mid,iconomi,"No, I'm involved in funding and investor relations everyday and understand things very well. Why do you really need someone to hold you hand once a week every time you have a new question for Tyne team, when you should do your due diligence.You, the investor are at risk if you're not researching the project properly. "
3768,Mid,iconomi,Thanks for the info!  I'll be posting it on the subreddit on monday.  :)
3769,Mid,iconomi,Could I use my online wallet from www.myetherwallet.com to store my ICNs by shapeshift??
3770,Mid,iconomi,"It will stagnate the price? What - that doesn't make any sense as an absolute statement. The price is determined by supply and demand. They're pushing the demand side of things, which increases the prices relative to what the price would have been with no buying-and-burning. If it's a bear market, it can help stagnate the price - and in a bull market it will increase the price further.  And you didn't answer my question. Do you disagree that buying-and-burning gives value to ICN holders?    >Do you not understand there needs to be another value source?   I guess not, please explain."
3771,Mid,iconomi,"It will stagnate the price, is that what you want? It's what you see happening now Do you not understand there needs to be another value source? "
3772,Mid,iconomi,I agree. Binance is really easy to sign up for and use. 
3773,Mid,iconomi,"Marketing starts after core features are developed, later this year.Iconomi, unlike most of the crypto projects, does not fall into the category of 'after all is said and done more is said than done'"
3774,Mid,iconomi,Only if the token has a purpose. Buybacks haven't done shit on the last few weeks. 
3775,Mid,iconomi,"I am on the same boat. I might wait for the next financial statement or AMA to come out. I don't want to trade my ICN tokens as a loss, but BLX is doing awesome!"
3776,Mid,iconomi,Everyone would trade their ICN for BLX if they would allow it on the platform. BLX has increased almost 100% in the last few months and ICN has lost more than 50% of its value. All of the tokens inside BLX have a purpose. ICN does not currently have one - the price is just speculation on what its role on the DAAs.
3777,Mid,iconomi,Do you disagree that buying and burning tokens is a way to give value to ICN holders?
3778,Mid,iconomi,"Why are you so confident in the token? I agree with the fact that Iconomi is and will do great. The token, on the hand, is a different story. If they would have told everyone that there would not be paying dividends, the price would have made it as high as it went after the ICO. We are still down more than 50% from two months ago. The token has a lot of catch-up to do.So, now that you now that the white paper is outdated. Do you still hold the same position?"
3779,Mid,iconomi,"I find it amusing that Jani finally shows signs of life by posting two quotes that do nothing to clear up the concerns of investors and people act like he just fixed everything. How about actually responding to the issues at hand? Iconomi made more than $200k in BLX in one day, great. That statement does nothing to help clear up the doubts that your investors have regarding ICN."
3780,Mid,iconomi,"I think attention will come with time.. maybe many people dont understand the Upside and security this gives.. but for 90% of people like us, who arent pro traders this is possibly the best idea."
3781,Mid,iconomi,You could deposit less than $1000 and transfer it out to something like MyEtherwallet. That way you don't have to worry about it growing more than that. You could then sell it on an exchange.
3782,Mid,iconomi,The price is waaaay of! 
3783,Mid,iconomi,"LOL $30k? They have millions for community managers, developers, analysts if they so choose. Calling it a waste is ignorant as to the value that it can provide to the company. Only responding a few questions once a month is poor communication. Regular updates are a waste of time? I guess you like as little information as possible to make your investment decisions."
3784,Mid,iconomi,Very! Feels like shapeshift is charging way more than other exchanges
3785,Mid,iconomi,This would be great for ICN if it is to be added by default on DAAs
3786,Mid,iconomi,Why would you still be here? 
3787,Mid,iconomi,"Binance - www.binance.com - You can use BNB (binance tokens) to have 50% fee discount.https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000583311-What-deductible-fees-does-BNB-charge-"

3790,Mid,iconomi,"It was added on the 18th, I think.It can be traded on the EtherDelta smart contract, but that's not really an exchange listing. So no exchanges yet.I think Iconomi will have done a good job of securing the platform. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what a worst case scenario might look like."
3791,Mid,iconomi,"Guess your right mate! I do have that option.. cant remember seeing that couple weeks ago when i set it up, but i could have missed it (or it was added..)Are there exchanges yet to sell/buy then? If so, then your right... then i guess cold storage would be the way to go"
3792,Mid,iconomi,Expensive!
3793,Mid,iconomi,I think it's interesting that they have also changed their token's value proposition. Do you know what it was before? I've never really looked into MLN.
3794,Mid,iconomi,"Seems to have come back to normal. I was hoping for some changes but there are none from what I can see. "
3795,Mid,iconomi,Could be due to the deposit/withdraw limits being imposed as it's the end of the month?
3796,Mid,iconomi,I'd love to see this data side by side with a FTSE100 or S&P500 tracker fund for comparison. Is it possible to add it? 
3797,Mid,iconomi,"I've seen some others mention that. Under my ""withdraw"" page, I have BTC, ETH, ICN, CFI and BLX. Is yours different?"
3798,Mid,iconomi,"Brilliant, please DM me a link when you're done!By the way - it's worth mentioning that BLX (formerly ICNX) only launched on August 1st (see here https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-platform-is-now-open-for-registration-d1cad79321ac) so all the funds in there previously were from Beta testers.We could expect to see much bigger burns now we are in operation - see this message from CEO Jani yesterday *ICONOMI fundamentals are healthy. Yesterday for example we got more than 200k USD into BLX with 308 buy events. It was no spike. Just an average day.* https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/6wyi6t/dont_panic_guys_this_has_happened_before/dmbtukg/?context=3 "
3799,Mid,iconomi,"They aren't the same thing, which is why they have different names and different definitions. You can't say it's ""not entirely true"". It *is* entirely true that we no longer receive dividends.But that's not even the point I was making. The point is that the whitepaper is outdated. Daparski's newbie guide on this sub is a better source of information than the whitepaper."
3800,Mid,iconomi,"So how can one withdrawn an token? I dont see that option on my iconomi page..? Just sell and buy. Regards"
3801,Mid,iconomi,I have looked into the smart contract and it seems that there is a function to block transactions. But not sure if it is used for that case
3802,Mid,iconomi,">It talks about dividends, which are no longer in place  I'm referring to the above, which is not entirely true, since they still buy and burn tokens, which is effectively dividends."
3803,Mid,iconomi,What's your point?
3804,Mid,iconomi,Buying and burning ICN is effectively dividends.
3805,Mid,iconomi,"BLX is a token, and can be withdrawn and deposited already. Once more exchanges add it, that's another place a hacker could offload it. They tend to track these things once they're aware of any hacks, but it can be done.If you recreate BLX to reimburse users, the hacker still holds the originals. So then there's too much BLX, with not enough assets to back them. So the price drops.BUT it might be set up in a way where it's not possible for a hacker to do this, even if he compromised the platform somehow. Or there might be some other measure in place that I haven't considered.The problem with stolen BLX isn't limited to Iconomi, by the way. But I'm just wondering what their own assurances might be on the matter."
3806,Mid,iconomi,"The whitepaper is outdated. It talks about dividends, which are no longer in place, and it's not linked to from Iconomi. Help centre... fine. They keep that up to date. But there's little use in pointing to the whitepaper."
3807,Mid,iconomi,Same for me :)
3808,Mid,iconomi,"> That means we make 90% of money we burn every day! So you guys are burning a 190k USD of ICN a day? At that rate, 190,000/3 = 63,333.33 are burned a day. So, in a month we should see 1,900,000 burned, assuming the price of ICN is 3 dollars... right?"
3809,Mid,iconomi,How do you know I'm not?
3810,Mid,iconomi,"I think most of us here believe in the project and are loading up at this time.I've looked at the whitepaper and the Help center. It didn't clear up the utility ""doubts"". I've accepted that we'll most likely have to wait for DAA's to be released fully before we will know for sure exactly how ICN will be utilized.As far as I know the team doesn't even know the specifics yet."
3811,Mid,iconomi,"If you believe that, why aren't you selling? "
3812,Mid,iconomi,"Some people are crying, but others like myself just want as much clarity as possible RE our investment in ICN tokens and the utility they play. The sooner this happens the better."
3813,Mid,iconomi,"I am still accumulating as well, doubled down this dip.  x2 in the foreseeable future and x4-8 before Q2 next year is what I think.  Even then I will keep about 50% of my ICN"
3814,Mid,iconomi,"The way i see it... might be wrong (?!)...Like you said, assuming untherlying assets are safe. Hacker stole BLX coins... ATM your not able to do anything with those coins correct? Since they are only created when you buy in, and destroyed when you sell out, what could a hacker do with BLX?As long as the only party ""buying/selling"" (detroying/creating) BLX tokens is ICN, any hacker that stole BLX woulndt be able to do anything with them. You cant sell them to ICN directly, you cant sell them on a exchange. Doesnt this mean that ICN would be able to recreate all stolen BLX tokens, restore them to the users affected and the world continues turning?This would all start to change the moment people are able to withdraw and deposit BLX as a coin directly! In my mind, the current system, as long as the untherlying assets are safe (!), is the safest way to go...just my thoughts on the matter, not sure i'm correct..."
3815,Mid,iconomi,"For me, the point of hodling ICN is that it's not as correlated with how the market or fund is doing. Also, long term profit (how much aside) is guaranteed due to the buybacks."
3816,Mid,iconomi,Kraken is fine. Just keep your ICN in your wallet.
3817,Mid,iconomi,"I think I'mstill not getting #3 completely.So there's the BLX, thats a cryptoindex, it's investible from the iconomi website for example.then there's ccp which is a closed fund that you can't buy into right now (how would you, is CCP another token?!)and then there's the ICN, so I can still profit from CCP by buying into ICN.So would investing into BLX via the iconomi webiste and buying ICN on kraken expose me to the ""full picture""?Current Cryptocurrencies via the passive BLX, blockchain technology companies by indirect CCP exposure via ICN?"
3818,Mid,iconomi,Kraken worked fine for me.
3819,Mid,iconomi,"No it's not. ICN is listed, not BLX. "
3820,Mid,iconomi,"Exactly my story man.I still play around with other stuff but since blx my life here is awesome and also the ether and other stuff recovers.Life is well."
3821,Mid,iconomi,si ma Jani ci puoi cortesemente dire quando penna icn PD
3822,Mid,iconomi,I bet we won't be too far away. Mazes out my $1000 on first day
3823,Mid,iconomi,Took me over 2 weeks .. not cool.
3824,Mid,iconomi,"> Of course previous milestones have had an impact.Yeah-- they caused the price to drop.>  We've been above 5$ at some point.Yeah we were, and it had nothing to do with any milestones, FYI.> You weren't crying back then, were you?Because we still had milestones ahead to anticipate further price movement (i.e. public release, second quarterly report, and additional exchanges). Seeing as those MAJOR milestones caused nothing but price drop, i have little reason to believe that the ""several major milestones"" will have impact on the price either."
3825,Mid,iconomi,Supported countries for tier 2 will be expanded dramatically soon. Patience is the key with Iconomi
3826,Mid,iconomi,"Be nice if Australians could deposit, or withdraw more than $1,000. Stupid ID laws (i mean isn't the point of crypto to be anonymous and avoid policy/legislation) "
3827,Mid,iconomi,Branding matters immensely so does reputation and investor satisfaction.
3828,Mid,iconomi,"Shall we clarify a few things Jani, having legitimate questions over the purpose of the ICN token does not qualify as 'FUD', surely you agree? These are normal questions investors ask, there is nothing wrong with asking. I still can't fathom how the platform purpose of ICN has not been elaborated on yet...ok we're told it will have a use with regards to DAA's, but without concrete figures about how many ICN will be required to perform X action, it is quite meaningless to an investor. So when will this actually be clarified? ***EDIT: I should say I do actually believe Iconomi itself is doing good things for crypto, playing a role in bringing crypto to the masses, and should be praised for that. But I would like an answer for my question regarding ICN itself, in order to be able to make an informed investment decision. "
3829,Mid,iconomi,"I believe Tier 2 is available for people with New Zealand ID, if you are going to upgrade to Tier 2 using NZ ID you must register with NZ as the nationality."
3830,Mid,iconomi,Wont work. What about those who own BLX and do have them on their wallet ?
3831,Mid,iconomi,OMG thank you for saying this.
3832,Mid,iconomi,You be blessed for posting this ! Amazing.
3833,Mid,iconomi,"Sold my ICN for BLX, I do not see a point holding ICN."
3834,Mid,iconomi,It took me around 2 days after I had the call. 
3835,Mid,iconomi,"I got an email telling ""there something wrong with your verication process. Please try again..."" somethibg along those lines"
3836,Mid,iconomi,"I don't spread hype. I dismantle FUD. I only state the hard facts given in AMAs and by the team. There is a fucking difference between actual criticism and saying ""the team doesn't answer questions, they don't hear us, they don't care about us, they manipulate the price, etc. etc."" because that's simply BS. Criticism would be to ask how to improve the project, it would be to critique the structure of the BLX, it would be to point to specific points of the project if you have a better idea of how to do it. Until then, what the team does is what the team does, if you like it or not. They have no obligation to do anything a random redditor tells them to do, it's *their* business, not yours. As investor you are free to voice your concerns as you do, but most of them can be answered if you actually read what they say in AMAs and blog posts.>Logic dictates that if I want ICN value to go up, I should just spread the moon talk and not address any relevant concerns until they are officially put to rest?I do not spread moon talk. You can check all my comment history, not once did I mention ""Moon"" or ""Lambo"". I am merely enthusiastic about Iconomi. Use case is a relevant concern. I agree. They announced one use case. They said they will announce more. What more do you actually want? Just have some patience, I don't understand people like you.You: I want to know the use cases of the ICN token!Iconomi: Here's one use case. More to be announced as we develop our platform.You: ??? What else do you want? What do you want them to say? Just have some patience, they will clear it up eventually.>I seek to maintain my investments in projects based on how issues are overcome and how teams are capable of addressing issues - if apple decided to not communicate with their investors regarding the concerns they have then everyone would pull out their money.The only issue there is is that you do not have enough patience. We are not even one year into this project, and everything besides the use case of ICN is going great - and the use case situation will get cleared up soon. The team is not stupid. They do it like this: Solve the issues, then do a blog post about it. If they posted on reddit about every little issue investors would pull out all their money. I guarantee it. I find it way more ""serious"" the way Iconomi communicates. I don't need a weekly github update. "
3837,Mid,iconomi,">Oh my lord... anyone with reasonable amount of iq would identify how you just regurgitate random stuff that makes 0 sense and know nothing of what has been going on with iconomi and their relationship with the communityI regurgitate what has been officially stated over and over again. Nothing else. I do not invent facts, I do not invent random stuff.>You state they have answered all the questions yet provide 0 references, therefore it is just you expressing your opinion as something Iconomi sald. Once again, visit the AMAs and provide references, because what you said is simply not even remotely anything detailed.Everything I say can be read in the AMAs and blog posts. I do not feel like linking 100 comments and blog posts because someone does not like the actual facts.>If something happens repeatedly with no sign of change, maintaining all charactetistics and conditions of the previous instances, it becomes a fact (are you really telling me that if something has gone from X to Y in the past, it does not become a fact???)If something happens repeatedly with the same characteristics it is merely an indication. In scientific terms you still need hard evidence. Evidence that isn't there. Facts do not exist without hard evidence. You say there is a pattern that Iconomi suppresses the price - I say it's free market at work. Unless you can provide evidence for your outrageous claim there is nothing you can do.>Also, no evidence of anything - check the freaking exchange before you speak crap, the walls were there the whole time whether you admit it or not.Anyone can put up walls. With millions raised in the ICO, **lots** of people can put up huge walls. Again, no evidence of Iconomi having anything to do with this at all. >In regards to ICN use, you just made.my point regarding the EXACT use for them. ""Further use cases to be announced"" is just retarded because it means investors have no clue what they are investing in. You probably have never wrote a business plan either, otherwise you'd know that there needs to be a clear outline of use case, not generalized ""used to open daa and more..."". There is no justification of having a working platform and a 100m+ project and not even telling investors what the freaking token does in full - shows there is no clear vision and plan (or at least it is not communicated).I fail to understand your issue with this. Obviously it needs a use case. And it has been announced. More use cases will be announced. We are not even one year into this project, it is not finalized yet, why don't you just have some patience? They don't force you to hold your ICN. If you do not like the way they communicate, you need to hit a decision. In my personal opinion, I will just hold and have patience as I firmly believe in the team. If you have lost your faith there is only one thing you can do, because I think the team is too busy with actual working stuff than answering people like you with zero patience. And besides that, having a working platform that generates revenue for ICN holders and brings new money in is awesome. I'll gladly have patience if they keep delivering. As I said, we're not even one year in. There are many other ICOs that are far less developed and noone bats an eye. As to point 6), am I supposed to link to every answer given in the AMA? They addressed the situation with the SEC in the US market, they addressed the exchanges, they addressed the use case situation of the token. What else do you need to know? Am I supposed to link to these answers? You can easily look them up."
3838,Mid,iconomi,"You are telling me that I am a greedy guy who got rekd holding icn - what does that make you. If all you do is spread hype and attempt to hide all criticism, then you are the bagholder scared of getting rekd by any small downward movement.Logic dictates that if I want ICN value to go up, I should just spread the moon talk and not address any relevant concerns until they are officially put to rest? I'd say this type of blind hype is the sole reason crypto is not at 500b already - 90% of the community is just childish and treat the investments as full speculation based on ""good team, undervalued, great potential, lambos"" and not really contributing to the relevant conversations we should be having. I seek to maintain my investments in projects based on how issues are overcome and how teams are capable of addressing issues - if apple decided to not communicate with their investors regarding the concerns they have then everyone would pull out their money. The success of projects like Iconomi will not depend on lambo talk, but on the maturity of crypto markets. Your type of attitude is doing more harm than good in the long run than a person who dares to ask concerning questions."
3839,Mid,iconomi,"Pardon me, I thought you were the same person."
3840,Mid,iconomi,"I'm a different person to the one above :-PI'm the one you were arguing with earlier, mein liebling."
3841,Mid,iconomi,You said they don't answer questions. They do. That's all I said. You're free to dislike any question. I downvoted you because of that. 
3842,Mid,iconomi,Where do you find it on EtherDelta I looked for a minute. All I can find is ICN not BLX or even ICNX.
3843,Mid,iconomi,"Noticed that too. I thought maybe they list EtherDelta's price, which might have a premium over iconomi's due to easier access to the exchange."
3844,Mid,iconomi,"What, exactly, is wrong with not liking an answer?There's nothing wrong with being positive, but you seem to be overly-positive, to the point you outright reject anything that isn't aligning with your own outlook. It's as if there's a barrier between your eyes and your brain that won't even allow the information to pass through before you've decided to reject it.Oh, and... http://i.imgur.com/ETSCa2H.jpg"
3845,Mid,iconomi,"Damn Jani let the fucking weak hands sell, they don't deserve any profit from ICN."
3846,Mid,iconomi,Wish the US would decide on regulations...... I'm stuck hodling ICN 
3847,Mid,iconomi,2tinfoil5me
3848,Mid,iconomi,"Exactly. I think that's where people are off in terms of management fees. Yes, if BLX would be a passive index fund, 3% management fee would be pretty high. But in fact it's not just a simple passively managed index fund."
3849,Mid,iconomi,"I'd love to compare them against the Bletchley indices. Actually I already considered them, since you provide various different ones, which is probably interesting to compare against (especially when you already hinting at Sharpe ratios ;). Looking forward to the release of your data and will add it to the analysis asap."
3850,Mid,iconomi,"Gosh, ya I actually wanted to do that as well. No idea why I forgot about it again... I will probably add it during the day. Thanks"
3851,Mid,iconomi,I'm giving it 2 years.
3852,Mid,iconomi,"1) I have followed every AMA very closely, you just don't like the answers they have given. Critical questions aren't ignored, but answered; but you don't like their answers.2) What are your super important questions? I'd love to hear them because I'm sure they have been answered in some way.3) Of course you can and should ask critical questions. 4) Same as ""I'm not a Nazi, but..."" Really. Why even post speculation when there's zero evidence for it, and can only damage the project and it's reputation? No ICN investor that wants it to succeed would do that. It's retarded. As for the positive talk, I'm sorry, but all the things I'm saying are based on official announcements and statements made in the AMA. I am not inventing things, unlike you.5) I've been holding since the ICO. I don't try to hide anything. I'm just debunking pointless FUD on reddit.If you really want your so-so important questions to be answered, why not post them in the next AMA? I'm sure you'll get an answer."
3853,Mid,iconomi,"1) They said it is not upto them to get listed on exchages. Question answered. They did get listed on Binance btw.2) This is **not** ""fact"", it's a baseless claim for which you have 0 evidence. I could look at Apple's stock pattern and claim ""moon in 3 days because of pattern lol"" and it would be the same shit claim.3) It's the open market. Deal with it. Again, no evidence for anything.4) ICN will be required to be burned upon opening a DAA. Further use cases to be announced along with the release of the actual platform. It's a project in development, you know? Do you understand that?5) Each BLX token still represents it's underlying assets. It's just tokenized, so other exchanges can list it which enables people from the US to invest finally. There will be a little arbitrage for it on exchanges, which should be fairly low due to people using it and making money that way. If you do your research as a potential investor, you should know exactly how much 1 BLX token is worth and should not overpay for it. If you don't do your research, bad luck.6) These questions have not been ignored, they have been answered. You fail to accept these answers because you simply don't like them."
3854,Mid,iconomi,Thanks!
3855,Mid,iconomi,"You portray yourself exactly as an average crypto investor who just follows what other people tell them to follow. In what time did critical thinking become FUD? The time where investors like yourself felt threatened if something not ""moon"" orientated does not surface in the topic. I get it that you are trying to promote Iconomi since your investment is at play, but so is mine. Nothing big was ever built without criticism and questions, since they are one of the driving force when it comes to success.Now... tell me how does that comment even remotely refer to:1) Neglected exchange listings (Bittrex and Bitfinex both have shown interest in Iconomi, commenting something along the lines of ""ask Iconomi, it is not on our end"").2) The quarter long stagnation before every quarter earnings report release - at some point patterns become obvious (this is not FUD, but a fact if you care to look at the charts).3) Massive sell walls manipulating the price at Kraken, which randomly disappear when earnings reports are about to be released.4) The clear outlined use of ICN tokens and their EXACT utility/functionality in relation to the platform5) If ICNX value comprises of the underlying assets in the fund, how can it be listed as tokens on exchanges (that removes value composition of underlying assets, and makes the token live its own life instead - when the underlying assets increased by 50% for example, the ICNX token on exchanges can increase by 100% due to hype - clear misfunction there).6) Why have the questions regarding all these things always been ignored or given generic politically correct answers to.If we as investors lack the fundamental ability to ask questions, then you are not really aware of what you are investing in and chasing pure speculation. Critical thinking is not FUD, I hope you can one day understand the difference."
3856,Mid,iconomi,"Hi, person that said ""Iconomi is too busy to play 200iq chess"" here.Basically the only point you're making is that the team doesn't answer simple questions. Did you use your opportunity to ask a question in the monthly AMA? I assume not.As for questions, it's absolutely normal for a company that size to not answer every question asked. Some things are still in development and not done yet, some things are too hard to answer, some things would be unfavourable to answer. It's normal. The most important questions have always been answered. The other questions (when POLO?  why no community manager? More updates? Mimimi?) are questions that are asked by pump n dumpers that bought into the hype, made a loss, and now want ICN to make a quick pump so they can sell. That's my take on it. The team is very professional, and so far it has delivered far better than I'd have ever expected (Blockchain.ONE listed on stock exchanges with regulatory approval within 2-3 months!). All the other claims you're making are baseless, there's no evidence for that whatsoever. Bring me evidence.You probably got rekt by your own greed."
3857,Mid,iconomi,"A co-founder just chimed in this morning. I was wondering how long before another FUD post about not enough communication. Not sure what answers would appease you.

3879,Mid,iconomi,It should take day or two after video call. If your video call was successful then you should have unlimited deposit limits and you can start using the platform. After final confirmation withdraw limits and tier 2 status will be granted.

3883,Mid,iconomi,Everyone says to never leave your coins on an exchange in case they get hacked. I assumed this would underly the same risk. Correct me if im wrong. How much are these transaction fees you are reffering to?
3884,Mid,iconomi,"Simple. They hold ICN tokens as a company and provide a small % based on various rules similar to staking... something like...- keeping the BLX tokens in their system.This would be desirable because it keeps people using the various aspects of the system rather than just collecting and trading the tokens on exchanges. - reward for how long you've held a token for. I'm going to use bitconnect as an example to illustrate a point but don't freak out this isn't meant to endorse it or compare Icomoni to bitconnect in any other way other than the way I describe One of  the reasons bitconnect is still around and is doing so well still where so many others like them have failed is that they have various interconnected systems which incentivize someone to keep their money WITHIN bitconnect. For example if you enter bitconnect you're forced to lock in your investment, the genius part is that those which do that will want to reinvest locking each time they do those deposits themselves into another set period of time. Their coin is also both required to buy in order to make a ""loan"" but it also provides a way for people  voluntarily buy it as a way to increase the value of  their interest before they reinvest it.  In order words  they aren't forced to reinvest and keep their store of value within their system but those invest the most will also be those who want to benefit most, and compound the interest rather than simply remove it, so they make you feel like it's your choice not to freeing of needing to actually pay out.  Very clever.  It's much like a bank, so long as everyone doesn't decide to take their money out at the same time it's ok. The difference is bitconnect don't even claim you can take out your cash whenever you want. My point is if people are sufficiently incentivised to bring value into the system and voluntarily not remove it then they don't just invest in your tokens or coins or whatever, they're invested in the entire thing which inspires a kind of compounding level of investment where  like  wave the more they get involved the more they want to as the more rewarding it becomes"

3961,Mid,iconomi,"For all FUDers I'll start with a quote from an article: ""First, the bubbly nature of the ICO market seems to favour the ability to tell a story over the ability to create a great product.

Because long term product makers surpass hype promoters by a lot.With all this FUD there is never conversation about fundamentals. Because you can not have ICONOMI fundamentals and FUD in the same sentence. ICONOMI fundamentals are healthy. Yesterday for example we got more than 200k USD into BLX with 308 buy events. It was no spike. Just an average day. With those numbers ICONOMI as a project is 90% cash positive! That means we make 90% of money we burn every day!

It's not exactly a novel idea, and as you stated is fairly common in traditional startups. As others have mentioned there is a limited time period before all their vested tokens are available to them. It is in their best interest to maximize the value of ICN during that time period if they plan to sell.   "

3972,Mid,iconomi,"Yes, obvious mistake is obviously a mistake"
3973,Mid,iconomi,I'll just keep repeating myself: jani8x has comfirmed that ICN must be used to create DAA's and will be burned in the process. The amount of ICN is to be announced.
3974,Mid,iconomi,"After they buy ICN tokens, they'll send to the burn address. Resulting in less ICN --> vakue raise, it's like a modern investment in a company where they give you dividend by raising the price of the token (Less tokens result in higher price eventually).Cheers!"
3975,Mid,iconomi,"That seems reasonable. I'm speaking to FUD as literally Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt; without the connotation many use as disingenuous. I understand there are concerns. There always are. If they had a definitive answer they would've said so by now. Considerations need to be made in a growing business. The thing is, I've worked in a startup with 100% year over year growth. Shit is not easy. Late nights. Early mornings. Weekends. Whatever it takes. These guys are dealing with even greater growth than that. I can't fucking fathom. What people have to understand is, things change week to week, and sometimes daily. Bottom line is I have faith in this team and the progress they've made thus far as well as the answers they've given. If there isn't more clarity before the end of the year then I'll start selling my position. Actions speak louder than whining. I just get the feeling that people in this space are a bunch of poor college students who feel entitled to 10x in a week on their $300 buy-in, or some huge bump on positive news. Well, you're not. You're entitled to nothing. We're all idiots for investing in this stuff. But you have to be to get the insane upside. May the money Gods smile on us all. "
3976,Mid,iconomi,"The difference is, the previous increases had the ICN token seem like an integral part of the future. The Iconomi team has all but abandoned the token with the release of the platform. This is why Iconomi the company has increased exponentially in value while the ICN tokenholder has gone in the exact opposite direction. The only way this gets fixed is if up ICN holders demand that the team find a way to integrate ICN into the platform in a meaningful way."
3977,Mid,iconomi,"We shouldn't have to interpret an answer though. It would take them 2 minutes to give everyone piece of mind and I see no logical reason to ignore it like they're doing.Again, this is not FUD. This is legitimate concern.

3983,Mid,iconomi,"Anyone who bought ICN on exchange is NOT a true investor anymore. Team doesn't get anything from you. True investors are people who invested in ICO and team got this money. We - the true investors - are holding and are still really happy with the profits. Even if price drops to 0.3$ we are still over 100% in profit. I think the biggest crybabies are people who bought all their ICN on exchange and are now making stupid demands to the team to do something about it hopefully they can pump the price and profit from it. Well sorry but it won't go so fast and easy. ICONOMI is a long term project, but if you can not wait for the bright future the team will deliver, then sell, move on and leave the team to do their work. Maybe someday you can buyback for $20."
3984,Mid,iconomi,"As many people have said, the company can perform brilliantly without the ICN token. Your entire position rests on the fact that you don't understand that. This isn't a share in the company. This isn't the traditional economy. ICN could be worth nothing, and Iconomi would still have all of the assets they currently control.IF ICN moons, it will only be a bonus on top of what Iconomi already own. This really isn't a difficult concept to grasp.I'm not saying it won't moon, or that it won't be given an amazing utility. I am saying that your reasons for believing so are fundamentally flawed. The fact they actually hold ICN themselves is not an incentive, because they didn't pay anything for it!"

3986,Mid,iconomi,"WARNING! Alternative OPINION! Hello guys, Just an alternative opinion for the FUD. Don't know if it's retarded, but I'll give it a go. Maybe the Iconomi doesn't need the ICN to moon RIGHT NOW. Imagine a hypothetical situation - broken down in steps-Iconomi team announces mega awesome utility use for ICN-Price moons and goes 3x to 6$-7$-Every ICN Holder Doubles or triples and the community puts on the high gear on Referrals-We already have 10 000+ registered users (most likely 15-20 000 by end of the quarter). With the rise in price and happy ICN holders we suddenly have double that amount of users. Shit lot of people put on the waiting line for Tier 2 approval --> Bad user experience. Not to speak on technical challenges similar to what exchanges are seeing in scaling x20 users in a quarter. -Just released platform suddenly cannot scale quickly enough to accommodate a 10-15x increase in users in one-quarter. -Bad experience for everyone. My personal opinion: Iconomi team does not have interest in mooning ICN price RIGHT NOW. IT's quietly working on scaling and being able to accommodate the new influx of users after tokenization of the DAA, referral programs and other nifty elements which will attract users. Ones all these elements are in place they suddenly push the price up with a few consecutive announcements + serious attempt of keeping the Iconomi preachers happy. TL:DR Alternative view: Iconomi team has no interest in high ICN price Right now. The platform is already under strain and high ICN price will lead to more users --> unneeded strain on the platform. Once they are ready to scale, they will address the FUD. "
3987,Mid,iconomi,"That's exactly what I've interpreted their answer to be: ""We don't have the purpose 100% dialed in right now, and when the full platform is launched we will announce specifics."" We should all be fans of this team, frankly. BLX making its way to traditional exchanges should have anyone with a nickel invested in crypto huge fanboys. And I do care about seeing ICN succeed long term, for sure. I just don't care if all you FUDsters obsessing over minutiae sell in the short term. Honestly, it'll be healthier for the project if you get out. But I have to say, all of these weak hands are just making this quarter's buybacks that much juicier. So thank you for selling!

3988,Mid,iconomi,Dreams dreams not without feedback of the Icn team .... dont undestand arent they eager to give feedback with all this panic . But nice to see someone is postive during these drama weeks
3989,Mid,iconomi,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL45pVdsRvE Just pointing out that there probably wouldn't be nearly as much FUD if ETH wasn't doing so well and we were solely considering the price of ICN in fiat. Long term I still think ICN will do better than ETH, but I know nothing. "
3990,Mid,iconomi,"1) So many things wrong this post; Why waste $30k on a community manager, I'd rather another developer or investment analyst.2) If you want regular updates, go look at any real project out there, saying 'we're working on this' is a waste of everyone's time. Monthly updates, monthly AMA's and Quater reports are very well respected for anyone who has a financial background. That is more than most projects do, and anything more than this is not a good use of the teams' time. Jani, etc. have so much more to do.Last but not least, products/services like these work in three ways:Customers first, employee's second, investors last.The customers and employees are happy, the investors will be as well, as it WILL be reflective in price.Giving anyone weekly update is actually LOL."
3991,Mid,iconomi,"/u/daparski before assuming incorrect things about me, my time of purchase or my age (all of which you got wrong - a lot), how about you take a look around in the subreddit and the slack. What do you see? Are you telling me this is normal? The fact of the matter is: nowhere else have I seen this much discontentment. A mix of value destruction AND a mgmt / dev team who appear to not give a shit just does not mix well together.Hence I find it perfectly normal that me and countless other people here ask for a sign from the devs that they actually do care. It's very little we are asking for.Not sure why you have a problem with that."
3992,Mid,iconomi,The only reason you FUD is because you bought the top or haven't done your X returns before the school starts. 
3993,Mid,iconomi,"Hi:  I have them on MEW and the tokens are added there.  When I go to MEW & unlock I can see the BLX under Token Balances.  Am I doing this right?1) Send some ETH to my Nano address to make sure wallet has some in it.2) Send BLX to ETH address on Nano by selecting BLX on MEW dropdwon.3) Send rest of ETH to same Nano addressIs that right?"
3994,Mid,iconomi,I second that. I have seen it happening multiple times. Most toxic slack I know. Rude people.
3995,Mid,iconomi,Nah... Only FUDsters are cunts. I am only fighting them.
3996,Mid,iconomi,... *could be* ...
3997,Mid,iconomi,"I do think ICN will pick up but if you can't understand why people have been badgering the team about the use of ICN you must be some kind of fan boy.FUD is spreading false rumors or negativity for no reason. The fact that the team hasn't stated any specifics about ICN yet is real cause for concern.They've been asked multiple times in the AMA's but has not answered it at all. Even if they don't know the specifics yet they could just say exactly that. ""We're working on it but we don't know exactly what the utility of ICN will be"". That would be an acceptable answer. Keeping quiet is not, if they expect people to have confidence in them."
3998,Mid,iconomi,"If you can break even, I think getting out now isn't the worst idea. We don't know why the token tanks, but it could go a lot further down."
3999,Mid,iconomi,"My English is very bad, but FUD is spreading just like you. You want to profit quickly without hard work. When the price was ICN = 0.5 $ there were exactly the same conversations and many not contented, then they calmed down. Now because of you it starts the same way"
4000,Mid,iconomi,Looking forward to August 1st? Isn't it already almost September?
4001,Mid,iconomi,There is no difference in storing blx at platform or in your private wallet so reward is useless.
4002,Mid,iconomi,"> ou re stupid to think someone holding free ICN bags of 100.000 to 1 million ICN is indifferent to it's price.I wouldn't have thought so either, but look at the current price. Once again: all crypto moons and ICN dies."
4003,Mid,iconomi,People have anger issue on here. I'm not looking for a quick profit. Stop drinking the koolaid. If I invested $1 into this it is my right to question what did I buy into. And as you know the icn story keeps on changing. All good though. Good luck with your investment. I'm sure icn will do 20x. And I'm also sure in your 10th reincarnation you will get to spend the profit. Meanwhile enjoy the next ama. 
4004,Mid,iconomi,"Do you know if the team has ever said the word ""stock exchanges""? Because in the blog post and AMA they said ""traditional exchanges"" and that could mean traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, as opposed to the iconomi platform."
4005,Mid,iconomi,"Buy them, same as the buy backs..."
4006,Mid,iconomi,"Happy that I went in at 1.01 when it was called ICNX and got rewarded with 80 percent return by now.Sad that Tier 2 is not supported in India and could not invest the sum I would like to. I was pretty confident on getting good returns through it as I was maintaining my own divesified portfolio before and it was giving good returns. Investing into BLX saves my time a lot."
4007,Mid,iconomi,"Of course! 700% income is still VERY high income!ICN was under ICO price one day (I bought few 1000 more that day). Read the BTC ICN graph."
4008,Mid,iconomi,"If you keep deliberately calling the team scammers and spread other FUD, that's what happens at some point."
4009,Mid,iconomi,"Warning: serious FUD ahead.What if the ICN burnt is not bought on exchanges but rather is the ICN owned by the ICONOMI team themselves? This would meet their objectives to burn ICN without affecting ICN price and given their current holdings, they could continue in this fashion for a very long time before even having to burn ICN bought on exchanges... The platform fees would benefit the ICONOMI team alone during that time."
4010,Mid,iconomi,They're slack is even worse. They ban you if you cast any doubt on managements intentions. When the mod themselves cant give u an answer. Well done!
4011,Mid,iconomi,"Not everyone that bought was planning to hold eth. Many people including me bought eth with fiat in order to invest, so yes, I made good profit. "
4012,Mid,iconomi,"Your ignorance is bliss. What do you think their salary is ? In Slovenia ? 10.000 euros a month or 20.000 tops ? What is ICNx profits ratio that don't belong to investors to maintain a net balance of zero ? The fee is 3% of 400 million of managed assets early so far, at best that's 12million of profit. From that you deduct buybacks going into ICN that leaves nearly no six figures a year profit. You re stupid to think someone holding free ICN bags of 100.000 to 1 million ICN is indifferent to it's price."
4013,Mid,iconomi,And where should they take the ICN from?
4014,Mid,iconomi,"What profit are you talking about? I bought at .03 ETH because ""early 2017""), but I guess that's my fault for thinking that ICN might dare go up in value in half a year."
4015,Mid,iconomi,"They made some mistakes. So what? If you bought 6 months ago, just take your profit and invest in a Shit coin that pumps 10x. I believe in the team and I know they will succeed. All the people that panic sell right now will regret it. "
4016,Mid,iconomi,"""early 2017"", right?"
4017,Mid,iconomi,I don't see it listed. Was it removed recently?
4018,Mid,iconomi,yea  Sia is dead in the short term IMO and Filecoin will very likely finish it off anyway
4019,Mid,iconomi,"BAT hasn't exactly been doing well.. Do you know something?They should buy a shit ton of Verg and Bitquence"
4020,Mid,iconomi,I'll see you in early 2018 when you cry because you didn't hold. 
4021,Mid,iconomi,"Verge they could buy a shit ton at the current rate, Bitquence because moon , (and Neo which for some reason isn't there?). "
4022,Mid,iconomi,Do we have any indication that BLX will be hitting an exchange soon?
4023,Mid,iconomi,"No, my main point is:""Then there will be plenty of opportunities, i'm sure, to jump back into ICN at significantly lower prices. It's just a silly coin to hodl.""An no, I'm not taking a shit on the entire project. I'm taking a shit on ICN. The Iconomi team is doing great--big opportunities, lots of profit *for them*. And you can wait for your Blockchain.ONE: just like you did for your reports, AMAs, platform release, buybacks, and additional exchanges. Clearly they've made a lasting effect on the price of ICN."
4024,Mid,iconomi,What exchange is BLX listed on?
4025,Mid,iconomi,"I agree. I would. I wouldn't buy Monaco like OP said because it's already expensive, BLX is still under $1.90/. Although at rate it's rising not for long. (Or.... If you're quick I'd buy Verge before it breaks out... you can use profits to buy more BLX if you want but Verg is super cheap and has a lot going for it. Right now it's at the end of it's retracement.)"
4026,Mid,iconomi,"Sell it and buy BLX (icnx) .That's been going up very fast and consistently If you wait, the less value the tokens have and the more expensive BLX gets,. You can always buy more ICN later."
4027,Mid,iconomi,"Basically you debunk your entire argument with your last sentence. ""because it has none of the above [yet]"". Yet. All of those points have been announced and they are working on it:Blockchain.ONE has regulatory approval and will get listed in 2-3 months. Columbus capital actually *was* a company before it partnered with iconomi, it does not give a false impression of luring big names in. It had operated a couple years before that already. ICN already has one use case announced, it is required for opening a DAA, and more use cases are to be announced. So basically you take a Shit on the entire project because they haven't implemented all of their features in not even one fucking year? You are seriously spoiled. I can't think of any other ico that has a working product that actually generates profit and brings in money from the old economy - that fast. What's your point again? Edit: you apparently have not done your research because ALL the fees from BLX and blockchain.ONE will go towards buybacks, not just 20%. The 20% figure is from ICNP which you by the way failed to mention, and which by the way also has a huge impact on the buybacks. They have millions of unrealized profit already from various investments. "
4028,Mid,iconomi,"> You have NOT done your research.Yes I have. I've been holding ICN for over 6 months now, hoping for some kind of deliverance from the team. I waited for their AMAs, for their quarterly reports, for their platform release, bought ICNX, got tier 2 verified on their site, waited for Binance, additional exchanges, actively offered suggestions and participated in their commmunity for a long time. I'm sorry that I screwed up of one detail which is pretty minor for *actual ICN holders*. But I guess it gave you a chance to pounce and get on your little soap box. Here, let's break down the terms:* Blockchain.ONE: A mythical fund that doesn't yet exist. 20% of profit from fees goes to ICN buybacks, which are specifically structured to not affect the market price.* BLX: The renamed ICNX crypto index fund managed by the Iconomi team.* Blockchain Capital: The rebranding of the ICNX DAA management team. Now consists of Jani and some finance professional. Press release gives the impression that it was an existing company that joined Iconomi, when it is actually an organization incorporated by Jani and said financial professional to give the impression of big names joining on. 20% of that funds profits will also go to ICN buybacks---which are specifically structured to not affect market price.* ICN: A token that...gets scarcer? You know how I know? Because I actually did my research and see that buybacks will be done in such a way to not affect the market.Ya know who blockchain.ONE will be awesome for? Blockchain.ONE holders and the Iconomi team. NOT ICN holders.Now let me break this down for you because you seem to have a hard time understanding:Asset value goes up based on Supply & Demand.What creates demand in crypto? * Hype. (expectation of future profits)* Perceived use case. (expectation of future profits) * A mooning price. (expectation of future profits)Which of these does ICN have?So while the ICN supply is supposedly decreasing through buy backs, the demand is waning--and continues to wane--because it has none of the above [yet]."
4029,Mid,iconomi,"Then why don't you do research about this project and team before you invest, and then complain it doesn't do 10x immediately after? All the information was there for you to see, but instead of taking responsibility for your own mistakes you blame it on the hard working team. "
4030,Mid,iconomi,"Okay. Here's the issue I have with people like you. You understand literally nothing about iconomi. You have **NOT** done your research. Not at all. BLX is not blockchain.ONE. They are two different funds. BLX is already live and fees go towards buybacks. Blockchain.ONE is a fund that will be listed on *stock exchanges* (which is **HUGE**) and fees from that *also* go towards buybacks. The more assets under management iconomi has, the more fees for buybacks, the higher the ICN price. If you don't think exposure to traditional stock exchanges where billions of dollars are waiting to get invested is a good thing, I don't know what is. Please for the love of God, fucking inform yourself before you spread FUD. I can't take it anymore. "
4031,Mid,iconomi,"Then there will be plenty of opportunities, i'm sure, to jump back into ICN at significantly lower prices. It's just a silly coin to hodl."
4032,Mid,iconomi,"Sure. But what does this have to do with iconomi itself? The Roadmap has been pretty clear from the beginning. If you bought eth with fiat, then bought into the ico you x20ed your money. If that's not good enough for you I don't know. If you held ETH before that it's your fault alone to invest it into an ico. There is no guarantee for huge gains. It's also hard to outperform eth, but I'm sure I don't have to tell you about that. "
4033,Mid,iconomi,"Why wouldn't they? It's free money, given by the ico investors. Given the current states of affairs with the  ICN token and it's usage, the team could completely walk away from ICN and business would still continue for them as usual. This is a possibility, do I believe it will happen? No, but the possibility is still there because of lack of utility and guarenteed trust through technology for the ICN token. "
4034,Mid,iconomi,"Hi,Yes BLX can be stored on ledger nano s. I do own and store them in it.To obtain BLX, you need to buy it on Iconomi platform or any exchangers which are trading them.No it wont transfer along. You need to add custom token on myetherwallet. You transfer the BLX then your ETH if you want to empty the wallet"
4035,Mid,iconomi,"icostats.com shows quite a few that have raised in value against ETH since their ICO.> Besides that, I am sure once we will get blockchain.ONE listed on stock exchanges ICN price will move up significantly.But why would that affect ICN price. It might affect BLX price--but not ICN."
4036,Mid,iconomi,"What difference would it make in the long term? None. As I stated before, the team is in it for the long run. Why do they need a quick 2x pump or something along those lines when prices would decline again soon after? The team themselves have stated that they want slow and steady, organic growth, and not stupid pumps and dumps. "
4037,Mid,iconomi,"That is, if you held ETH instead. Why would you think that iconomi can outperform a well established token like ETH? Plus there's always a risk with Icos, if you can't handle it, well.. How many other coins managed to outperform eth in the given timeframe? I can imagine not too many. Besides that, I am sure once we will get blockchain.ONE listed on *stock exchanges* ICN price will move up significantly. "
4038,Mid,iconomi,"They are indirectly tied to the company's performance, due to the buybacks. The company still profits, the team still gets paid, as all ICN holders are. I just explained to you that if iconomi went bankrupt ICN holders would get their proportional share paid out. Now where's the issue? What's the point you're trying to make? "

Their main moneymakers are ICNX and ICNP--neither of which have anything to do with ICN except for buybacks. Which are deliberately structured to NOT affect the market price of the token."
4045,Mid,iconomi,I just telling you the POV of the Iconomi team.

4047,Mid,iconomi,"With ICN though, it's almost never the case that the investors bought ICN with fiat, so their ""rich rewards"" still pale in comparison to the ""richer rewards"" of having simply held the ETH they used to buy ICN in the first place."
4048,Mid,iconomi,"Their ICN holdings aren't tied to the company's performance, you fool.

That's a free car, a down payment on a very nice house, a fat stack of more promising cryptos, and/or a lot of drugs.

Should keep re-balancing and impact to the asset to a minimum..I think what a lot of people ignore is the impact such a DAA could have on coins with a very low market cap or low trade volume.. If you have the least bit of success with your DAA and people say invest 10 mio overall, that would require you to buy 500k of CVC, which is close to 10% of the global daily volume.. Buying these amounts in bulk would cause you to get very bad rates in the buys and could also have a massive impact on the price itself.. in the last days even with BTC we have seen larger sellorders (0.1% of daily volume) on Bitfinex pushing the price >2% up or down.."

Imagine if the price shoots to like $20 a token it would be impossible to burn a meaningful amount of token in a reasonable time period.So either the price goes back up or the burn backs eventually would trickle the price back up."
4096,Mid,iconomi,"Yes and no, ICN is ATM highly oversold on all timeframes from 1h RSI to 1d,  this is a great accumulation period (and I would buy if I had any more free funds). The problem I see with this approach is this however: How can you put price tag on **trust**, if too many people now get burnt with this price manipulation, it can seriously damage public ICN image.... if you see first 20 searches on google saying ICN is a scam and lots of people lost their money... you will not want to invest in such a company or its fund. So either this price suppression ends soon or ..."
4097,Mid,iconomi,"Acctually you dont need many Billions for the price to rise substantially. 1 billion will make 30 million dollars in buybacks. And then we havent included Pinta fund with their 20% payback. This Fund is growing BIGTIME! I have never been more optimistic with any coins i had in Crypto. Its so undervalued.. "
4098,Mid,iconomi,"I see. So that's good for the long term holders here as well then, if you believe the price of ICN will increase more than whatever other coin you would consider investing in instead."
4099,Mid,iconomi,I think the only relevant question is at how much you bought ICN to determine butthurt status of said holder.

4103,Mid,iconomi,Yes you do.
4104,Mid,iconomi,"Only thing I can think of is the fact that 7milion ICN tokens that would be distributed to the team are still locked for another year (3.5mil in 6 months), from a financial point of view it makes perfect sense for team to burn as many tokens in buybacks as they can before they receive their funds. Team members are long term ICN investors... they do not care about the price now or price speculation in short term since they will not sell their tokens anytime soon."
4105,Mid,iconomi,"RemindMe! 3 months  ""Is ICN underwater and below 3$, today ICN is 0.006 ETH @ 2.25$"""

4110,Mid,iconomi,Why is it not possible? Just not an option to include on the platform currently?
4111,Mid,iconomi,"Yep you are right. ICONOMI team are the greatest CON artist around.. probably in the world! They took our money, created the platform we profit from, are trying to deliver FIRST cryptofund to real world exchanges. As I said ... best CON ever!"
4112,Mid,iconomi,What low price?
4113,Mid,iconomi,"Well it is best you pour yourself a glass of milk, go to your bedroom and cry into the pillow."
4114,Mid,iconomi,"I'm all in with BLX. Index Tracked funds are the way forward for me. I'm aware I don't have the time, experience or knowledge to invest confidently in single coins, so investing in, essentially, the concept of cryptocurrency is perfect. Certainly what I'm recommending to others. Buying & selling BLX has been a bit of a learning curve, especially keeping fees down from GBP, but it's taught me loads about trading, accounts and exchanges along the way, so worth it. "
4115,Mid,iconomi,"> (cheaper buybacks).It doesn't work like that. The buyback amount gets spent each period - if ICN is cheaper they buy and burn more ICN; they don't get to keep more money."
4116,Mid,iconomi,">gives the impression that Iconomi is unconcerned with the sentiments of investorsIt gives that impression because it's the truth.  They *are* unconcerned with investor sentiment.  The Iconomi team feels that eventually, those who were smart and strong enough to hodl ICN will be richly rewarded, while the weak dummies who sold miss out.  To Jani especially, price plunges like this are just the free market at work, as ICN moves from the dumb to the smart."
4117,Mid,iconomi,"Remember the team holds a shit ton of these tokens. Knowing they have a huge, vested interest in seeing this thing succeed should give everyone confidence in and of itself. Honest to God this has to be a FUD campaign by short sellers. I just can't believe there are this many people this interested in spreading FUD. Either you've bought in and that's that, or you don't like what you see and sell. I see no utility in the constant badgering for a team that's more forthcoming with monthly AMAs, quarterly reports, and meeting milestones than just about any other out there. It doesn't add up. Keep calm and HODL everybody. Or don't. I don't really give a shit. "
4118,Mid,iconomi,"Like every icn holder, we need to stop giving management the benefit of the doubt. They need to answer our questions and stop giving us the run around. We had enough! We need to know how the profits and loss of the company are reflected into the icn price. You can't be profiting while your shareholders so to speak, losing their shirts. We need answers. What's our leverage? We funded this company after all! They are profiting from our investment. Am I hearing my echo sound? I bet they will repeat the same rethoric in the next ama. ""The use of icn will become clearer once we launch .."". Stop insulting our intelligence"
4119,Mid,iconomi,Monero (XMR) is in Iconomi's assets isn't it? 
4120,Mid,iconomi,This is a pathetic show considering the health of the entire crypto sphere. Sell walls killed the fintech star
4121,Mid,iconomi,Nice said
4122,Mid,iconomi,Stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. We all lost our shirts on this. We need to know how icn reflect the profit and loss of the company. Obviously they are profiting. Why we are tanking. We need answers not run abouts
4123,Mid,iconomi,"Correct on 1., 2. and 3.;)"
4124,Mid,iconomi,* in the past 8 months
4125,Mid,iconomi,If that would be the case ICN would shoot over 100$ without additional investors. Just us holders and the buybacks <3
4126,Mid,iconomi,"Price does not change when the supply gets increased unless it hits the market, which is not the case because the team won't sell at this stage"
4127,Mid,iconomi,Orphaned transaction apparently.... 
4128,Mid,iconomi,"1. They trust what they built and they are using it as a wallet.2. They are divesting into the DAAs themselves.3. They love answering questions in a way that causes more questions and couldn't pass this opportunity up.4. Some of the team wants to sell so they moved it to the platform first to obfuscate the coins on the blockchain, i.e. a sudo mixing service. Now you won't be able to track who on the team is selling their ICN stake."
4129,Mid,iconomi,"That is also my opinion. Plus you have to understand it's probably holidays weeks for most, if not all, employees.  As if they were humans, you know."
4130,Mid,iconomi,I hold taas and there is a big difference in coin supply. Iconomi is 10 times larger. So profit sharing is divided into further portions
4131,Mid,iconomi,OMFG I was drunk and I posted some whales I can't believe it got more than 50 comments! Ahahahahah
4132,Mid,iconomi,"Coinone, yeh. Trading has started already (about 5 hours ago) Hit about 460k satoshi before trading started there, and currently hovering around 400k."
4133,Mid,iconomi,"There is a lot of information for those who got 5 minutes to find out why the ICN token got value. If you dont find out in 5 minutes, please sell because we are many who is loading up for a big raise in price. And the price will not go down to this levels again. Ever! ;)"
4134,Mid,iconomi,This is a bit unreal. But nice attempt
4135,Mid,iconomi,Calm down fudders! _ôï_
4136,Mid,iconomi,? Sure blame me for Iconomi having poor communication and marketing while still not clearing up the use of ICN. Maybe it is because of YOU telling people to sell and leave instead of asking Iconomi to improve. By the way your English sucks.
4137,Mid,iconomi,"I would buy even more than I am and have more confidence about it too. I can't convince my dad to buy either if I can't tell him what the token is used for.It's just a shitty situation and there is only 2 reasonable explanations for it.1. They used ICN for funding and now left the initial investors behind.2. They don't know how to utilize it properly yet.I'm definitely leaning towards the latter and I'm buying what I can, but I can understand why people are not happy with the missing information. "
4138,Mid,iconomi,"Qtum should do well, its listed on some major korean exchange now, however i believe it only starts trading tomorrow..price could go either way.Mainnet launch is a pretty big deal, and with the extra exposure of a few big exchanges , logically the price should pump!Unfortunately, i dont have money to buy now, or i would! Short term bet is on Monaco, but will def get into Qtum after"
4139,Mid,iconomi,The ICN have been moved onto the platform.
4140,Mid,iconomi,It's been at 99.90M on worldcoinindex.com for weeks...

4143,Mid,iconomi,"What's your projection for Qtum? I picked some up today. Probably could have waited for a better buy zone, but I'll be waiting on the mainnet."
4144,Mid,iconomi,"+1, Iconomi has the worst FUD out of any legit project I've ever seen.  It repels people from the products/community, which leads to shorter highs and less fees for buybacks."

4167,Mid,iconomi,"They already received the start up funds required from the ICO and subsequent price rise. They now have a functioning product. Its probable that they don't care that much about ICN holders anymore.The token doesn't do anything right now. They talk about baking it in somewhere, but mainly to appease the crowd of holders.It's like they got VC money with no strings and didn't give up any ownership. That risk is why investors are not pouring money into ICN. It's primary purpose was to raise funds. "

4170,Mid,iconomi,I remember seeing somewhere they said that if ICN matched the qualification criteria then it would be added to ICNX. Now that it had been renamed and there is a new manager of the fund though I don't know if they are keeping the criteria the same as before. 
4171,Mid,iconomi,äóìcheaper buybacksäóì :D :D :D
4172,Mid,iconomi,One zero too many
4173,Mid,iconomi,They could specify how ICN tokens are to be utilized.
4174,Mid,iconomi,"Could it be the team's vesting schedule and distribution? It has been exactly 1 year from the ICO. It was at it lowest 6 months ago as well as today.""The 8 million tokens distributed to the team are vested over 2 years. This means that Œ_ of all tokens are distributed every 6 months."""
4175,Mid,iconomi,"Um, maybe they can actually tell us what ICN will be used for in detail and commit to being more communicative and actually bother to do some marketing?"
4176,Mid,iconomi,"In the short term maybe, but they (The Iconomi team) hold a large number of ICN tokens which I'm sure they would like to monetize in the not so distant future. "
4177,Mid,iconomi,Do they only get paid with ICN?
4178,Mid,iconomi,"20% of profit from ICNP and the fees from the platform go towards buybacks for ICN, so the only way the team makes money is through making ICN succeed. It all depends on each other."
4179,Mid,iconomi,"Honestly, what could they possibly say that hasn't already been said to assuage all the FUD monsters?"
4180,Mid,iconomi,"Well there are a lot more cheap ICN available now as ICONOMI TEAM have put their 13 million that they had kept, into the circulating supply.Total deflationary tactic, purposely dropping the value of all ICN circulating immediately by 13%.Of course, they never thought of letting anybody know this was in the roadmap for 2017 .... time to bail !!!"
4181,Mid,iconomi,"/u/fruchty and /u/jani8x I swear to god, if you know how to read, take this post to your hearts.

GROW SOME BALLS AND AT LEAST COMMUNICATE WITH US FOR GODS SAKE."
4182,Mid,iconomi,I wholeheartedly agree with you
4183,Mid,iconomi,"Dude, they don't need to care about ICN or keep ICN holders happy. It is a complete waste of their time. They have the platform, the indices and more exotic/well managed DAA's on the way, all targeted at traditional BIG money. They are hunting for tens, dare I say hundreds, of billions of dollars of assets under management, and the ico investors/ICN holders ain't going to do shit to help with that. The more time the company spends getting big, conservative money on board, the better off everything will be (for Iconomi, at least).If you hold ICN, do the math. The token's success entirely depends on buybacks and hype (which results from fat buybacks). Buybacks aren't going to amount to much until Iconomi has MANY $billion AUM, so your whole strategy is to wait patiently while Iconomi ignores you to get the real work done, and then TRUST (this is crypto, we don't like trust) that they do right by ICN holders, honoring their commitment to buy the token back. "
4184,Mid,iconomi,"You can buy back and burn the Useless Token and the price wont go up - because people don't want it - because it has no use. That is what happening with ICN, the token has no use. It is not a currency nor a stock. "
4185,Mid,iconomi,"If that were the case, buybacks alone would be enough. The further use cases for ICN are expected to be revealed when DAAs are live."
4186,Mid,iconomi,"Exactly, Iconomi can become a billion dollar company with huge profits, but the ICN token, with no current use, will remain at on the floor stagnant."
4187,Mid,iconomi,"Yes. Also, most large hedge fund managers, for what that's worth."
4188,Mid,iconomi,You are right.
4189,Mid,iconomi,With the millions of dollars they have there is no excuse for not having a community manager / social media person. For example a well known program called The Cryptoverse requested an interview with Iconomi and apparently they didn't want to get the free publicity and an opportunity to answer some questions. Is it really that hard to have a representative have a webcam session? Only bothering to answer a few questions once a month with no technical updates is not acceptable either (for example Augur has weekly updates on developer progress and project occurrences). Why is the communication so poor? How much longer will it take for them to figure out what ICN will be used for? Just saying they anticipate it will be used for DAAs and that people should wait until the end of the year to find out is ridiculous.
4190,Mid,iconomi,I'm glad that the community management topic is still being raised in a constructive manner.  Iconomi's community does not present well and gives the impression that Iconomi is unconcerned with the sentiments of investors.
4191,Mid,iconomi,"Well this was 132 days ago, haha.They were faced with a lot of questions/concerns, which they were just deleting. The team were deleting reddit posts, and the mod at bitcointalk was deleting posts there. There was a big fuss about it on r/ethtrader as people don't like censorship. This sub got less attention because they stopped deleting everything they didn't like.The platform is functioning fine, but concerns still exist over Iconomi's business practices, and whether the ICN token is actually worth buying anymore."
4192,Mid,iconomi,"Sorry to ask, but could you provide some links or sources of what's happening? Don't know much yet, but imo the whole thing seems to work, or? Thanks!"
4193,Mid,iconomi,"""anymore""? What has changed that makes you think so?"

4197,Mid,iconomi,nooo don't say that
4198,Mid,iconomi,"Well there's not much to trade and talk about. ICN is slowly going the way of the Dodo. I think the whales are slowly pulling out, as small time investors come in. I don't see a long term benefit in holding ICN anymore. "
4199,Mid,iconomi,The issue was that many new posts came in after launch. reddit thought they are all spammers
4200,Mid,iconomi,"http://mcaptoken.com/ - wtf is this people?Been stagnant so long competition is deciding they can do the same thingHopefully ICN will start capitalising on their position today, competition is great but it must be destroyed:'{"
4201,Mid,iconomi,"HA !Small update from the team is looking like too little too late, still not listed anywhere besides Kraken, no word on the utility of the ICN token on the platform, still got a wall of sell following the price down, still pretty much nothing going on except the death spiral the price is still going throughI would like to see some confidence in the current price, but the channel we are in is pointing to a 100% retrace of prices down to 0.005 levels, though there may be support around here around the double bottom / 38.2% fib from the last high @ ~0.0094BULLISH - can not get much worse.. right?Also we should have daily updates from the # team, there is enough going on in the space to warrant it"
4202,Mid,iconomi,I haven't had any issues like that but I've heard rumours. Can you post it here for us?

4204,Mid,iconomi,"I mean, it has only been 3 days, 2 at the time of your post. Statistics over a 2 day period mean nothing.Depending on how your post was formulated, I think it should've been allowed.

4205,Mid,iconomi,Well aren't you a Warren Buffet in the making

4208,Mid,iconomi,"Number of users, funds invested, basic business statistics that would enable an informed investment going forward"
4209,Mid,iconomi,"Yes, after such a long lead time, been patient for long enough. Already taken my profit, as you can see the price does not look healthyI would hope and expect that ICN would release statistics relating to the launch on the first day that reveal the number of signups etc or at least a timeframe for reporting such information"
4210,Mid,iconomi,It could be an auto moderation thing
4211,Mid,iconomi,"What do you disagree with how the team communicated? They released on 1st of August like they said, they have monthly AMA's... What update are you looking for?"
4212,Mid,iconomi,"You have not been following the project long enough thenThink it is pretty clear from the statement above I am talking about communication and being supportive of the priceAt the moment it seems like the ""team"" and investors are against eachother"
4213,Mid,iconomi,"What are you talking about?Imo the Iconomi team is one of the few that actually makes their deadlines and delivered a working product"
4214,Mid,iconomi,"Anyone else that feels the same way please speak up, ""team"" can not censor you hereIt is absolutely pathetic that even after such a long lead time they can not get their shit together and at least go on a PR course or something "
4215,Mid,iconomi,Also think about the healthy profit Iconomi will post next quarter thanks to a platform launch/ BCC asset sales/ coin market growth all combined!
4216,Mid,iconomi,"Nowhere to be seen Very disappointing to have not had an update from the team on number of sign ups, institional investors or any other basic statistics1 day momentum looks to be turning red too"
4217,Mid,iconomi,"Yeah I agree.  The only thing ""revolutionary"" about casinos is that it teaches you how to lose your rent money among other financially destructive habits."
4218,Mid,iconomi,I think it was $0.13141592 USD
4219,Mid,iconomi,What was ICO price?
4220,Mid,iconomi,"Relax, it's a long time coming and crypto funds are new, if you have invested fundamentally. You'll be fine. Its not all 200% gains 24/7. And the market can go up as much as it can go down."
4221,Mid,iconomi,I've already withdrew double what I put in from ICO. Sticking it out for triple digits at this point
4222,Mid,iconomi,"ICN is the only top 25 coin in red (except for BTC) Wtf is going on?"
4223,Mid,iconomi,Price increase?
4224,Mid,iconomi,"What finance degree and program covered crypto markets? I also wouldn't tell people to take their money to a casino instead of investing a little in a crypto asset. I understand the point but it didn't go over well here. Casinos aren't revolutionary, decentralized technologies that could drastically change how we live in the next 10 years."
4225,Mid,iconomi,"A nice slow steady price increase is probably better, though mabye things will pick up once this bitcoin nonsense is finally over"
4226,Mid,iconomi,Fantastic! Good work Iconomi team! Can't wait to see how popular this becomes!
4227,Mid,iconomi,"Thought I'd post this here as well.I think we're seeing a nice price-increase right now, though I thought it would have a more immediate impact. Curious where we'll reach our new stable price point."
4228,Mid,iconomi,We can has rally now?
4229,Mid,iconomi,sorry not sorry
4230,Mid,iconomi,Any idea when? 
4231,Mid,iconomi,I can definitely see a correction for Eth back to $100.
4232,Mid,iconomi,Shows over guys owenoneilluk just bought all the ICNX :(
4233,Mid,iconomi,"What you thing regarding some tube analyst that predict a dip on eth to 100$ and a move up to 300? Most of them think there is gonna be a dip again - deeper than the last correction. "
4234,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think anything is going to happen. I think some huge whales are keeping the markets (BTC, ETH, ICN) stable right now and they will do so for the next foreseeable future, through the hard fork and the launch of Iconomi. Don't forget, we had a sizeable correction a few weeks ago, and stability is what we need. If the above scenario is wrong, then I guess the alternative is a slow increase for ICN after the release of the platform (assuming nothing goes wrong). ICN has been kept pretty stable and is already valued pretty highly, so I don't expect a huge increase. I think the three key words in the minds of the big players right now are stability, stability, and stability. I would be happy with $6 or $7, but that already feels like it would be too much. "
4235,Mid,iconomi,"This, I'll be grabbing all the ICNX "
4236,Mid,iconomi,"People see it as an extremely good investment, especially whales. That's why they are (in my opinion) putting up incredible sell walls to keep price at bay and slowly accumulate more. Once in a while we have a pump where the average r/ethtrader user will jump on the FOMO train and sell at a loss afterwards. That's where both small time traders like me and the whales make their gains. I have an ICN trading stack that almost doubled already due to this movement. Today I sold at 1650 and rebought at 1600 multiple times for example. (ICN/ETH pair). Just bide your time and hold. The price increase will come soon enough. :)"
4237,Mid,iconomi,The 5 was with a higher marketcap and ETH at 400.
4238,Mid,iconomi,"I don't understand how people is blind and don't see ICN as a really good investment - both as asset and opportunity to gain profit. Hope that ICN team will do a great launch tomorrow in both side crypto maniacs and the rest of the world that is approaching.We arrived at 5$ before Easely and without a platform release. "
4239,Mid,iconomi,I think everyone's waiting for a price increase ;)
4240,Mid,iconomi,"Hi - thanks for the reply - I was hoping also today for some price increase - many spoke 3/5usd - Hope tomorrow will go fine for ICN Release the platform tomorrow - still trying to catch the good reason mate"
4241,Mid,iconomi,I expect a price increase for ETH and ICN within the first 24-48 hours after the hard fork. I may be completely off though. There is a lot manipulation going on with the ICN ratio right now.
4242,Mid,iconomi,"Tomorrow is the BTC fork, there are countdown websites in the /r/ethtrader dailty thread. Tomorrow also is the platform release.This may mean a pump, or it means nothing. I personally think some people will sell their BTC/BCC after the split and buy back in ETH, meaning ICN will go up. And some will buy ICN/ICNX. I don't know what price you have assumed we'll reach on 'pump day'...but the whole market is unpredictable."
4243,Mid,iconomi,When?
4244,Mid,iconomi,"Good thing they changed it, otherwise the SEC might be knocking on their doors"
4245,Mid,iconomi,Alts will be on the rise for sure imo 
4246,Mid,iconomi,"All speculation here, but with the heavy amount being invested in BTC/BCC and traders selling at a loss, there might be a huge flood back into alts post-Aug 1st, ICN included."
4247,Mid,iconomi,"Mabye if the price of btc/bcc falls along with alts, icnx may fall in value too, all these new investors picking up cheap icnx before the market recovers. Seems like a good way to grab some future profits if timed correctly?"
4248,Mid,iconomi,"And for that they choose august 1st? In order to see ICN value going where, up to ? Or down to?"
4249,Mid,iconomi,I think they don't want to overvalue ICN too much. It suits them perfectly fine to see only a slight increase or movement in price. 
4250,Mid,iconomi,2 q relesed no pump unfortunately 
4251,Mid,iconomi,"They know the date from a long time - so - if they decided to release this date there are only 2 options:1) they want an excuse to explain why the ICN is not increase ( but decrease) so nobody can say nothing. 2) they know something that we don't know and I hope is this if not they are not fair. And may be ICN will benefit from what will happen. The team know what to do - is impossible that they decided august 1 without thinking (shit decision).I HOPE THEY WANT THE BEST FOR ICN VALUE "
4252,Mid,iconomi,"Shit move, no one will take any notice with BTC/BCC party in full swing."
4253,Mid,iconomi,Great news!
4254,Mid,iconomi,"Tbh i always thought launching on 1st August is a bad idea, precisely due to this."
4255,Mid,iconomi,I think at the moment all the attention is on BTC
4256,Mid,iconomi,"Such pump, much wow"
4257,Mid,iconomi,"The thing is, I don't think iconomi will go up to its full potential in response to this news until it gets listed on more exchanges. Practically 98% of the volume is on Kraken. If it was listen on Bittrex or something else, it would help increase liquidity a lot."
4258,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think the rumor of ICN launch is spreaded that much though, I'm hardly seeing mentions of ICN in other subs. I'd think the working product will bring more attention and money to it. "
4259,Mid,iconomi,"Google ""buy the rumor sell the news"""
4260,Mid,iconomi,This question is asked too much.
4261,Mid,iconomi,"I think we will see 2 big pumps, one when the Q2 report gets released and another around Sunday or Monday, I see the price going to about $7 pre launch, then settling around 5$, then hopefully a steady sustainable growth after....This is my thumb such guess, dont quote me or trade on this.  My dream price is $10!"
4262,Mid,iconomi,"I would check their Twitter feed perhaps? Just did a quick scan but did not spot it, if you know the date it will be easier"
4263,Mid,iconomi,Really? I tried searching for confirmation but could not find it. Do you know where I can check or have a link?
4264,Mid,iconomi,They announced that they won't be having another crowd sale

4271,Mid,iconomi,Who says there was a consensus that Melonport had more potential? Iconomi has the first to market advantage. What I like about Melonport is the modular approach that allows developers to contribute. Not sure why people would buy MLN now when they will have another crowdsale next year.

4277,Mid,iconomi,That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. 
4278,Mid,iconomi,No when market cap goes down all Alts suffer.
4279,Mid,iconomi,Up to 3.41ä‰å down to 3.15ä‰å than up again - 5 hours like that 
4280,Mid,iconomi,up?
4281,Mid,iconomi,"How is going? "
4282,Mid,iconomi,"Exactly. It's all good, I've made just as much money trading what I pulled out at 60 than I would have had letting it sit there until now. Now I've got my conviction to fight off any FOMO down the road. "
4283,Mid,iconomi,Just money
4284,Mid,iconomi,"The price is doing better than I expected, but I got rid my tokens a couple of days after the announcement. I have no interest in holding something that's strictly for speculation. I get the reasoning as to why they will be worth something, but I bought in to the ICO so I could use the platform and get divs for holding the tokens, then I find out I can't do either. Oh well, no love lost."
4285,Mid,iconomi,I know. And the price has severely paid for that 
4286,Mid,iconomi,"Also a great way to miss out on an opportunity as you are never guaranteed to buy back in lower when you sell, thats how people end up buying back in at a lossNext wave of buying should show now as MACD on the 15 and 30 mins starts to turn green"

4289,Mid,iconomi,Still good time to buy more _ôÖ_
4290,Mid,iconomi,It doesn't pay dividends. They changed the model of the ICN tokens to a buyback and burn.
4291,Mid,iconomi,Being right is nice huh?  
4292,Mid,iconomi,Q2 Report shall be out this week...next pump ahead
4293,Mid,iconomi,That's happening now
4294,Mid,iconomi,I agree.  The project is extremely underrated.  I think we should some positive price action in the coming weeks. 
4295,Mid,iconomi,"well the beta is good. but not that spectacular, because it provides the very basic functions. but i'm definitly excited about the future of this project.Nevertheless, i have also an early access to prism.exchange by shapeshift which heads in the same direction, but the platform looks more modern in my opinion."
4296,Mid,iconomi,"Hi All! At the end I was like you -- thinking what to do if buy or not more icn (already 2739 at 2.19 ä‰å each) at the end I bough it more additions 2286 at 2.54 ä‰åeach total 5025. Average 2.35 ä‰åI was hoping for a dip to buy at 1.40ä‰å like last Sunday but at the end if ICONOMI is going to be the first digital platform for cryptocurrency and if bitcoin like everybody are saying is ""solved""  I believe that the price will rise more Thant was on June --> 4ä‰å minimum --> everybody looks what is ICONOMI - I sold all my xrp eth XLM to buy only iconomi because it will give me for sure x2 - If will be a dip --> I have my last part of euro to buy cheap and decrease the average under 2ä‰å! Status is skyrocketing right now and they don't have any product available --> ICONOMI from august 1st yes and is a platform user friendly and than can be used by all the world.Now capital market is 260mln --> just increase to 1000 and will be at 10 euro --> x4 from now.Best and buy it may be half of you capital now and half if you don't see any dip."
4297,Mid,iconomi,UASF is not going through. BIP91 has already been signalled and SegWit is supported.
4298,Mid,iconomi,"Buy now !!"
4299,Mid,iconomi,"We reached 5.48 with a total market cap of 111b. Now it seems like ETH took a hit on the hype, so with a new 111b total I think we'll see about 4.25(if all goes well with BTC). Add about 30% after initial platform release and we'll see 5.50 after launch.This is all guesswork, slightly based on past prices.I personally woulnd't count on another dip this week. It seems BTC will get past it and the total market cap has been rising."
4300,Mid,iconomi,"i think it depends on the bitcoin decision...this is the biggest threat in terms of a potential dip/crash from my point of view.if UASF goes through, I don't see ICN going down"
4301,Mid,iconomi,"We'll do, will be amazing.I bought ICN from 1$ to 2$ at different price, then stopped, and during the big dip I was buying again, specially from 1,5$ to 2$. Iconomi has a solid project, I like their idea/concept and ofc the team behing that. Nowadays isn't mainstream or common yet, but in the future as all the markets manage funds and assets in cryptoworld will be critical. At this point ICONOMI is being the lider there you have ICNX for exemple.Could be nice see ICN token at 7-10$ by 4Q-2017 and 30-50$ Q4 2018.In ICONOMI we Trust."
4302,Mid,iconomi,Might see $6 to $10 around a week within release. I think $20 is possible by end of year !
4303,Mid,iconomi,"Go go ICN Anyone care to share their short/ medium/ long-term projections and price targets?Am hoping that we will see a rise up to 0.0426 in the near future, not based on anything apart from 78.6% fibonacci retracement Have not yet conquered the 23.6% fib @ 0.015 though we are fast approaching it, should be a strong breakthrough with the 1 day momentum just about to go green "
4304,Mid,iconomi,"This isn't enough. I'll believe a rally when we rally green against when everyone else is red.I'm hoping that come August 1st, the Iconomi release date mixed with UASF offers a rally against odds. Butttttt probs wrong."
4305,Mid,iconomi,"We seem to have stalled, can not decide if this is a clear rejection or clear support of the 50% fib line So I guess it's not clear, eh?Edit: Weeeeee"
4306,Mid,iconomi,The crypto market has been in bloodbath mode re: forking 'uncertainty' for nearly a month.  The weak hands have been selling throughout.  At some point only the bag holders are left and they are too stubborn too sell.  That's when prices start rising.  I think there is a decent chance the lows are in.  
4307,Mid,iconomi,Sure but we are outperforming ETH on the ETH/ICN trading pair and nowhere do I see anything up as much as we are right now
4308,Mid,iconomi,The top 50 coins are all in the green today. It's not just ICONOMI that's up.
4309,Mid,iconomi,"Anticipation of the release of the platform on August 1st, I would say is a strong reason"
4310,Mid,iconomi,"Maybe, but what is the human reason for a major market rally before the uncertainty of August 1st? I personally don't see one."
4311,Mid,iconomi,"Am a little more convinced that this isn't just a fad after looking at the Fibonacci retracement levels We are exactly (~) at 50% now after having bounced off 38.2% levels a few days ago"
4312,Mid,iconomi,IMHO there's no real reason for the small rally and everything will crash even harder next weekend.
4313,Mid,iconomi,I agree I find this to be a great time to buy.
4314,Mid,iconomi,"I'm buying 100 icn today, at half the price I bought before. Let's hope for the best ;)"
4315,Mid,iconomi,Eaten up just now !
4316,Mid,iconomi,"We are not pulling back as hard as other tokens, at some point people will notice and buy in."
4317,Mid,iconomi,I appreciate you.
4318,Mid,iconomi,That's a good point.
4319,Mid,iconomi,"if you think it's going to keep going down you would sell then buy in tomorrow when it's down another few %.I don't do it, but in hindsight i should have sold last week and bought in today :)."
4320,Mid,iconomi,"Hi... I've noticed the same.Yes, they don't seem to be deleting like they were before. Lots of good discussion has been going on.I think they've realised that they can't control the conversation in that way, else it reflects badly on the project."
4321,Mid,iconomi,That was someone who did a dumb mistake with advanced buy orders on Kraken.
4322,Mid,iconomi,"If you mean ICN tokens, there is no correlation since those aren't the tokens that represent the index fund."
4323,Mid,iconomi,How could we capitalize on this to put it to our advantage? In what scenarios can it be beneficial in regards to day trading?
4324,Mid,iconomi,Yeah noticed that. But the drop comes never the less. And it doesnt go up as fast as the others.
4325,Mid,iconomi,"There is a high chance of a good rise of ICN in coming months as the platform goes live, and buybacks will raise the price further in the future. It's a good side investment from your ETH stack.That is what I'm doing as well and I even bought a bit more for the short time and will sell that extra part when price rise to my first target around platform go live hopefully."
4326,Mid,iconomi,I believe in Iconomi 
4327,Mid,iconomi,The last downwards movement few days ago was done the same way. No idea how low we go.
4328,Mid,iconomi,"i hope that it goes without a hitch, and to be honest i think it will. given this happens the crypto space will get major mainstream news coverage, either because the uncertainty surrounding the no1 inroad to crypto has been removed and the price for all crypto explodes and secondly because reddit/4chan/fb/twitter will be ablaze with traffic and media love that.  the question is for me will icn price increase at a larger percentage than eth when this happens?  "
4329,Mid,iconomi,Kraken
4330,Mid,iconomi,Are you trading on Kraken or Liqui? 
4331,Mid,iconomi,ICN/ETH if going sideways several times a day which allows to buy sell around couple % difference. I used to buy / sell 1k ICN and make close to 1 ETH per round. Now the spread is more narrow than several weeks ago thoughäó† so less interesting but still able to get profit.
4332,Mid,iconomi,"ETH is probably safer over 3-5 years. ETH is still very development heavy and I expect it to stay on top of things. When/If cryptocurrency becomes mainstream, ICN will probably have many competitors without much difference between each one. ICN has the advantage of being the first though. I do think ICN has a bigger % gain potential over the years though, and the time to step in is <platform release. All in all I think it does make sense to step in with 20% now, as long as you can take the higher risk."
4333,Mid,iconomi,August 2nd
4334,Mid,iconomi,"i think there is no reason to think that segwit implementation will go wrong, so i think:1. segwit gets activated - small bull run. i think it will be a small bull run because everyone knows that segwit is going to be ok so i think the current btc price has the segwit activation already weighted in. 2. alts go down for a short period during the small bull-run, than another bull run on alts starts - i dont know if its going to be like just a few weeks ago where we had 115b mcap total.3. again big uncertanty about the hard-fork - btc goes down dragging the rest of the market, after it (hopefuly) hard-forks successfully - huge bull run on btc, alts down again4. only after btc's run starts to slow down a little bit - alts are going up.What does it mean for ICONOMI? i think that if the platform launches as announced - icn will resist the fall that the alts market is going to take - but i dont think it is going to last for a long time - after all, all the assets iconomi is holding are going to go down. so i dont think we will have a big growth until like christmass....Having said that, i'm still not selling my alts (and specialy not icn).....i don't trust my evaluations enough to do it :)"
4335,Mid,iconomi,"If it's so easy to predict them, it shouldn't be too hard to explain the mechanics behind it. Otherwise it's just gambling.. "
4336,Mid,iconomi,"seams the buy side is growing some momentum/volume"
4337,Mid,iconomi,Its been incredibly easy to predict them. 
4338,Mid,iconomi,to be fair up until yesterday it has been quite predictable to a degree. now we have a large sell wall pushing things down by the look of it. 
4339,Mid,iconomi,If only it were easy to predict the dips! 
4340,Mid,iconomi,Even with a trading bot it is extremely difficult to become succesfull in day trading. I would not spend any precious time that you can use for other satisfying activities in life. Best strategy (and this will also give you peace of mind and a good sleep) is buy the dips and HODL until you have reached your goal(s).

I have seen some of their posted videos and read their medium posts and I still don't get what problem are they trying solve (or if there's actually a problem to be solved). Their products supposedly range from a completely peer-to-peer, non-regionalized and universal distribution environment for artists to an equipment rental marketplace. That just seems too wide for a company that is yet to release something tangible.In addition to that, the language they use is full of ""never before seen"" features and ""you will not get it if you don't have a decentralized mindset"" type of statements. For me that just smells of some good marketing budget with a shitty product behind it. At his stage, I would not recommend anyone putting their money in this project."

4360,Mid,iconomi,"Depends when ETH hits $400 again.  Next week?  Yes ICN will be cheaper in terms of ETH then.January?  No, ICN will be more expensive in terms of ETH then."
4361,Mid,iconomi,"Yes, thats true the expectations often drive the price. What i tried to say was that if the whole market is down the positive effect (of the expectations and the news event) might be lower than when the market is stable.

4362,Mid,iconomi,"Well we've seen before that the price actually went to the new high BEFORE the news came out. A good example is the Q1 report. ICN went up before the report came out, was pretty stable for a while, and then slowly started going up more. "

4368,Mid,iconomi,"Four figure ICN, that's extremely bold. The burn rate of the buy back shares won't help push that figure until their profit (not revenue, is in the tens of millions).Plus, that's an est. $87.5bn market cap (including some shares getting burned)"
4369,Mid,iconomi,Remember that liqui.io has 1 ICN withdrawal fee. I've contacted their support about just just now.. hopefully they updated that soon.
4370,Mid,iconomi,"Your 400~500 is a good amount, your current stash, assuming its 500 ICN is currently worth $2,050 at current market price of $4.10 If lets say the price of each ICN were to be worth $100 each, your 500 ICN would be worth $50,000 not bad!  But it doesn't have to stop at $100 each, it can be $300 each or even $x,xxx each  who know the future is full of surprises.  In year 2010 no one had any idea that bitcoin today was going to be worth $2,500 with a tremendous multi billion dollar market cap, so with that said, we absolutely have no idea if ICN is going to be worth $x,xxx in the future with an extraordinaire market cap, but there IS a component that is playing in your favor that MIGHT cause the price to ever reach the $x,xxx range, is that ICONOMI will be burning off ICN coins and, lets say, ICONOMI burns off like 7 million ICN's per year, its going to take a few years before the total ICN in circulation today of 87 million gets further down reduced to a much lower number, THAT plus a much bigger market cap can give you the $x,xxx long term future ICN price valuation.For the sake of the very long term example, lets say 1 ICN is worth $1,158.77 each, your 500 ICN at that stage would be worth a total of $579,385 enough for you to buy a good house almost anywhere in the USA you like and pay for it in cash and clear provided the house doesn't cost more than what you are left with after paying capital gains taxes.With all that said, good luck with your stash of 500 ICN's may the future bring you, and everyone who is in ICN great rewards *This post is not a prediction, a guarantee or investment advice, its provided here entirely AS-IS.

4371,Mid,iconomi,"Out of curiosity, how much icn does the average folk own? I'm somewhere between 400-500 and feel like that is a decent amount for a recent college grad that has limited income. "
4372,Mid,iconomi,Thanks man. 
4373,Mid,iconomi,This. Fees are reasonable too on Kraken.
4374,Mid,iconomi,Thanks for the advice. 
4375,Mid,iconomi,"Usually you are paying for the laziness. Best method is to visit coinmarketcap.com, find your alt and look for the top exchange by volume. That's where shapeshift gets it from anyways except they take a cut. For icn, it's kraken.  "
4376,Mid,iconomi,That was my suspicion. What's cheaper? 
4377,Mid,iconomi,Shapeshift is expensive. One of the most. 
4378,Mid,iconomi,"There is no such thing as an ""ICN max Price"", the price of ICN is entirely dictated by total market cap divided by all the 87 million of ICN in circulation today.  For example, the Right Now price of $4.01 that you see on coinmarketcap.com is calculated based on a total invested capital of $348,910,890 divided by 87,000,000 ICN's =  $4.0104 to be exact.  So, the higher the invested capital goes, the higher the price of each ICN gets, there is no limit on how high the price of ICN can get.EDIT:If you were referring to the maximum price ICN has ever reached on this year 2017, then to the best of my knowledge, the highest prices I have ever seen ICN this year was $5.40 USD."
4379,Mid,iconomi,"Something tells me that those who invested into ICN will be in the longest ever reaching ""homerun"" later on when the price of each ICN reaches triple figure prices.  Keeping in mind that ICN is a deflationary currency/token ICONOMI will be burning off potentially millions of ICN per year, when a few years has passed by there will be so little ICN left on the marketcap that the individual prices of each ICN might be in the $x,xxx range, a great day for ICO to Today's investors that managed to HODL all the way to that particular time in the future, so even if you bought say at $10 each somewhat in the very near future you shall be richly rewarded if the price ever reaches the $x,xxx range in the long term future.  Not only that, but I can easily see in the long term future almost no one wanting to sell their ICN as gradually the holding of ICN tends to flow from the common hands to the smart hands where the smart ones tends to see potentials and HODL for the long term future further increasing ICN prices."
4380,Mid,iconomi,"Yes I am aware everywhere has margins. I'm looking for advice on how to minimize that margin. Shapeshift is fine as a service, I'm looking for fee comparisons. "
4381,Mid,iconomi,Everywhere will have margins. Why have you heard shapeshift is not good?
4382,Mid,iconomi,"I don't think the dip has ended. Since the beginning of the year prices of all coins are irrationally inflated. And the behavior, that the price movements are similar for each coin (every coin goes red or green) shows me, that a coin is not evaluated on it's value proposition, but that movements are driven almost only by emotions."
4383,Mid,iconomi,Can anyone point me to the calculations regarding icn max price 2017.
4384,Mid,iconomi,Yeah i hope the report comes after the market is stabilized otherwise the positive effect might stay out..
4385,Mid,iconomi,"My thoughts on what the price of ICN will do? Well, that largely depends what the rest of the market will do. *However*... the strength of ICN comes from its diversification so it protects itself from volatility more-so than other ""alt-coins"" which don't have the same business model. The question you should be asking yourself is... do I buy more today... or is it going to keep dipping down more tomorrow so I should buy more tomorrow instead of today? :P"
4386,Mid,iconomi,Same!
4387,Mid,iconomi,Hey man! Welcome to the club! Once the world wakes up to ICN it'll be a hot new thing! _ô_Š
4388,Mid,iconomi,Thanks.. Those directors are probably just bribing when they get in trouble.. Modern tyrants.
4389,Mid,iconomi,"Limited liability protects shareholders from responsibility. So if you invest in an LLC, you're only risking your investment - and not agreeing to take on corporate responsibility.The directors are still duty-bound to make the best decisions for the company and its shareholders - and can become personally liable if they are proven to be making decisions that only benefit themselves... as far as I understand it."
4390,Mid,iconomi,"So I googled LLC:> A limited liability company (LLC) is a corporate structure whereby the members of the company cannot be held personally liable for the company's debts or liabilities. Damn. Why do we allow this? Ain't this great for scammers or unconscious scammers? This what happened back in 2008?"
4391,Mid,iconomi,"[... you're a bit behind the times.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/697cbr/iconomi_ama_may_2017/dh4lv1f/)All corporations have limited liability features.  But this is not an LLC."
4392,Mid,iconomi,I guarantee they formed an LLC.  Theres no way to know where since they dont answer anybodys questions.
4393,Mid,iconomi,"The Iconomi team is engaged in an enterprise that everybody hopes will increase the value of ICN.  Full stop.The definition of ""common enterprise"" is extremely broad.  And it's not something that you defeat with legal technicalities or LLCs.  Hell, there isn't even an LLC involved here so I don't know where that's even coming from."
4394,Mid,iconomi,Yeah but they didnt invest in an enterprise.  The asset is not legally bound to the LLC they formed.  Its literally attached to nothing.
4395,Mid,iconomi,"Thank you. Very insightful.So that whole ""They won't list ICN because it's a security"" argument was always lacking anyway. I still see posts saying ""Now dividends are gone, why aren't polo listing?"" etc.I've not seen any new answers on the AMA today, despite Jani telling me it would be completed ""tomorrow"", 23 hours ago.The quest for answers continues. "
4396,Mid,iconomi,"Well I am a lawyer but not a securities lawyer, although I do have some familiarity with those issued from when I was working with some smaller companies in Silicon Valley.But here's my opinion:  Under US law, ICN is absolutely a security.This would be the case even if it no longer represented an ownership interest in the company.We primarily use the [*Howey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.) test to determine whether something that isn't e.g. a stock, note, or bond is nonetheless an ""investment contract"" and thus a security.It's a 4-part test whose elements are:1. People invested money2. In a common enterprise3. With the expectation of profit4. Achieved predominantly through the efforts of othersAnd that's exactly what happened with ICN.  People invested $$ into Iconomi expecting that their ICN would appreciate in value via the efforts of the Iconomi team.The thing is though, Poloniex lists *tons* of coins that also satisfy this definition.  Hell, there's even a [good argument](http://decentralizedlegal.com/ether-is-a-security/) that *ETH* is a security.  So to say ""Iconomi isn't on Poloniex and Bittrex because it's a security"" is naive.  GNT, GAME, RLC, GNO, etc. etc. ad nauseum are all almost certainly securities for purposes of US law.  In every single one of these, investors who are not involved into the day-to-day enterprise have given money over for tokens, in the hopes that the team they gave money to will work hard and end up increasing the value of those tokens.Kraken takes regulatory compliance and risks to its well-being just as seriously (if not moreso) as Bittrex, Poloniex, and all the rest.  There is something entirely separate from regulatory concerns keeping ICN off of other exchanges.  What that is, I don't know."
4397,Mid,iconomi,"Yea, I think the problem you have is the noob shills won't ever let legitimate concerns even be raisedInstead you get this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1789926.msg18917181#msg18917181"
4398,Mid,iconomi,"Don't get me wrong... I'd love ICN to succeed. I don't want anybody to lose their money.It's just better to clear these things up early on. I'm as much in the dark as many others. I just like to employ a more critical approach to things, rather than blindly following.I've had a direct message from Jani stating that the AMA will be completed, so look out for that.I've also forwarded this post to /u/snkns (who is a lawyer) and asked for his input on what I've said here.There's so many questions in the AMA that never even occurred to me, and make me feel like my points are just the tip of the iceberg.I seek only to clear things up. It's not my intention to 'destroy' this project. Hopefully the complete AMA will hold more answers."
4399,Mid,iconomi,"lol.. yea... giving people a dose of reality in the icn subreddit is a huge nono"
4400,Mid,iconomi,You've been a naughty boy.
4401,Mid,iconomi,"dividends or not doesn't change the fact that it is a security.ps i have now been banned from the iconomi subreddit :P"
4402,Mid,iconomi,"Hypothetically speaking, under the current opaque scenario the team can still manage to get substantial advantages even if we assume that they deploy a legally enforceable agreement to bind themselves to buybacks and that they eventually release the platform to the general public with all the features they originally promised (albeit I still consider those as highly unlikely occurrences). In other words, they donäó»t need to äóìwalk awayäó at all, as long as they are at the helm of the project with no boundaries whatsoever.Some random examples come to mind:1.   At some point the team could choose to lower the platform fees, set variable volume caps/conditions or change other terms or token attributes in a detrimental way (with respect to profitability for the token holders) to attract more capital and gain a better market position (or build a stronger brand with a larger client base) for their ownäó»s sake only. ICN tokens would face a drop in EPS and market price would plunge accordingly.2.   The team could strip-off lucrative chunks of business which have meanwhile arisen (because of ICONOMI market position or client base) and put them into unrelated, new entities ICN token holders have nothing to do with. Cofound.it is a brilliant example of this.3.   The team could launch new investing tokens or services - different from ICNP/ICNX - pretending that each of those represents a new vehicle for special tailor-made investment/service to be listed, sold, traded or shared *outside* the original ICONOMI agreement, hence preventing (or limiting) any direct benefit for ICN token holders in terms of profit sharing.Even if we rule out blatantly upfront fraudulent conducts (like costs inflating or financial misreporting) possibilities to capitalize on their position are countless, and only depend on how demand and market for crypto services develop in the future and how many opportunities arise. The team maintains an almost complete freedom in picking what has to be shared with token holders and to which extent. Meanwhile, ICO crowdfunding capital will still fully cover all expenses and there's nothing ICN token holders can do about that. "
4403,Mid,iconomi,"I agree that a white paper removed and replaced by a new one with substantially different terms and provisions after the ICO has ended is bad business practice at the very minimum. The outcome could be unpredictably nasty if things go pear shaped while the original sales agreement didn't even mention ICN - let alone shareholding.It's worth noting that even if crypto lacks a special regulation, general law principles still apply in full, more so when it comes to financial crimes allegations.That said, it would be definitely tricky for token holders to seek justice without any clearly legally binding agreement and by even ignoring whether a real company for the project exists or, if it does exist, where it has been incorporated and what the relevant provisions of the memorandum and articles of association are."
4404,Mid,iconomi,"It's been happening the past few days.If any new potential investors are reading this: I would advise you to avoid Iconomi like the plague. Hold onto your BTC or ETH. Iconomi is a dead duck."
4405,Mid,iconomi,"Your fourth point regarding ICN tokens is the most pertinent. Those tokens were issued with ZERO value, after receiving tokens of value in the form of BTC, ETH, LSK, and fiat.Yes, it would be nice to cash those tokens in and net a few million dollars... but if you're already sitting on 10 million+, you're not going to be too bothered about giving value to some worthless token you generated on the Ethereum chain."
4406,Mid,iconomi,"The whitepaper on their website and the whitepaper that the sales agreement links to (which has been removed) are completely different.  The one the sales agreement (for the ICO) links to has zero language about ICN holders having any rights to literally anything at all.  In fact, it doesnt even mention ICN. These guys put the wrong white paper on their website hoping people assume its that one in time. In other words, this is a scam.  As soon as the equity holders of the LLC they formed in some random county decide they dont want to pay for buybacks anymore and instead just pocket the fees, games over.  Iconomi is literally the reason crypto needs regulations, because asshats like this team will rip off investors if they are not in place."
4407,Mid,iconomi,"Iäó»m not convinced itäó»s a scam either. A poorly planned and poorlier managed äóìfailing experimentäó perfectly matches my feeling. I am still not assuming any ill intention by the team - other than a sloppy attitude - but the underlying moral hazard is unfair nonetheless, as it leaves ICN token holders to their own devices while ICO funds keep on footing the bill for something those same token holders could possibly not profit from.The more time passes the greater the chances for such an unfavorable scenario become (I am gathering together my previous comments here):1.   However one looks at it, the buyback announcement has been an alarming red flag, given that the dividend issue was something easily foreseeable since the very outset of the ICONOMI project. The later turnaround towards buybacks because of dividends impracticability - technically a false claim - made the team look amateurish in their approach to investors and short-sighted in their ability to properly plan corporate business stuff, to say the least. Actually, buybacks serve the only purpose of putting as much space as possible between ICN tokens and a full-feathered security, while bringing a lot of debatable side effects as a consequence - most of which have already been analyzed in depth elsewhere. The suspect raised by many people that the team intentionally promoted dividends as a fast selling hook capable of locking up as much starting capital as possible during the ICO appears quite grounded.2.   It seems to me that ICONOMI team used/uses legal concepts like *shareholding* and *ownership* as interchangeable, while they are definitely not. During the ICO stage (and later on) the team repeatedly referenced ICN token holders as *shareholders* with proper shareholding status (including voting rights). The white paper - which has been further modified after the ICO ended - states that äóICN tokens represent ownership of the ICONOMI platform, allowing their holders to receive dividends and vote on ICONOMI related issuesäó. Not sure whether this was an intentionally deceptive misrepresentation - I am assuming they hired a law firm before issuing their ICO - but itäó»s quite disturbing. Shareholding and co-ownership carry pretty different legal implications, both in scope and in applicable law principles. Also, dividends are paid by companies, not by co-owned services. Still, many people swear they are ICONOMI shareholders because the team said so (as a side note, to date there isnäó»t still any evidence that an actual entity exists for the ICONOMI project - let alone an entity whose shareholding/stakeholding is made up exclusively by ICN token holders according to clear and legally binding terms).3.   Speaking of those äóìrelated issuesäó mentioned in the white paper, I can think of at least two occasions when such issues have clearly arisen: dividends turned into buybacks and Cofound.it strip-off. Those were financially and strategically meaningful events for every ICN token holder, capable of significantly affect token value, yet no vote ever took place on those matters. Makes me wonder what a äóìrelated issueäó is according to the ICONOMI team and how exactly a token holder is supposed to vote on such issues. This kind of unbalanced and asymmetrical power in the hands of the team is concerning, regardless of whether or not ICN tokens represent shareholding or co-ownership. Token holders are completely defenseless against unfavorable initiatives carried out by the team.4.   The main argument used to confute any ill-intentioned scenario - the team has skin in the game (13M tokens) hence they have no incentive to bring the project to failure - is weak and overstated. Contrary to conventional crypto coins and tokens, ICN tokens donäó»t bear any using value independent from their issuing entity. The ICONOMI team here is the only part owning the actual value in their business model (opposed to, for example, Bitcoin Core or Ethereum Foundation, where the network's value is the real deal, it can outlive its founders and those same founders have no incentive to walk away). If the teams walks away then ICN token value plunges to zero. At current ICN market price we're talking approx. 5M USD worth-of tokens, on top of 10M USD funds already collected during the ICO. If ICONOMI team spots a way to *autonomously* earn multiples of that figure (there are many ways they could capitalize on their brand, market position and know-how) then 5M USD in missed capital gains represents an insignificant ticket price for such an outcome. Messing up the whole project becomes an economically efficient strategy, and it doesnäó»t even need to be carried out in a destructive or blatantly upfront manner. Hypothetically, claiming token *impracticability* because of any of those aforementioned loose ends in the project (either legal or technical) or even endlessly delaying the release of valuable platform features will suffice for the team to let ICN tokens quietly sink into oblivion while saving their faces with plausible arguments."
4408,Mid,iconomi,"Jani is a clown. What does he even do? I don't think he's developing - just heading development. He seems to have all the time in the world to mock investors, and visit North Korea, but no time at all to answer questions properly. Fair play to him that he's getting away with it.I'm not convinced it's a ""scam"" exactly. More like a failing experiment. I also think your concern about what binds them to honouring buybacks is the least of their problems. Even if they answered that question, there's still so many more unresolved issues floating around."
4409,Mid,iconomi,Agreed.  Im thanking baby jesus right now that I decided to exit ICN and buy 3 PIVX masternodes a week or so ago ;) Congrats to yourself as well.
4410,Mid,iconomi,"I'm up 300% in other coins, in the past couple of weeks already, while ICN has been knocked out of the top 20. I'm not all about the quick gains, but it's still a nice bonus.The way the team are handling themselves is terrible, and the community are just enabling it. They don't seem to realise that all of this supposed ""FUD"" would be prevented if the team actually responded to questions.I feel the same about fools buying it. Any gains won't be based on value - it'll just be because they manage to fool the next wave(s) of schmucks into buying it. That's fair enough, if it makes some people money, I suppose - but it's not a sound investment. It's no better than a ponzi scheme."
4411,Mid,iconomi,"When their asshat representative ""jani"" was playing stupid and not answering tough questions about ICN (even deleting posts off the iconomi sub that he doesnt like) that's when I called it quits.  Honestly fuck that guy and fuck this team.  I moved from simply asking tough questions to straight up against this scam pretty fast after that experience.  Still no answer to the question about the what binds the iconomi team to honoring the buybacks btw.  Well never get it because they know answering that will be a nail in the coffin."
4412,Mid,iconomi,"You got it.  The team is a joke in that they cant answer real questions.  They resort to acting like children and just shout ""FUD"" at everything and hope nobody will ask those questions again.  I pulled all my money from ICN and put that money to work in other crypto assets.  ICN will never significantly rise, there are gaping holes in the model and the iconomi team damn well knows it.  Ill be damned if I let this team steer me into a paperweight of an investment as every other crypto is rising dramatically.  Who knows, maybe they will sheep enough fools into buying ICN that it goes up though."
4413,Mid,iconomi,"Thank you for creating this sub. I created a reddit account so I could post here.The censorship in the official ANN has gotten out of control now. The moderator started by deleting any legitimate concerns about Iconomi, but then he began allowing some posts to stay. But he and his pals would still call it trolling and shout people down for having a different opinion. Now he's back to deleting posts, because he's decided it's all FUD and trolling again.It's become quite pathetic in the Iconomi community. There's only a few people who don't have their heads in the clouds, and can see the various problems with this project, and the team.I've read some very interesting points on here. Already this sub has been better for discussion than the official bitcointalk thread.This is shaping up to be one of the worst investments around, and Iconomi and its community are fast becoming one of the biggest jokes in crypto."
4414,Mid,iconomi,"Excellent post. I've been thinking similar things myself recently.I believe the team are not able to solve the issue they stated in the February investor update:*""... it would be extremely easy for ICONOMI digital asset arrays to substantially affect the price of digital assets, leading to loss of value and opening the door for potential abuse""*... which they, unprofessionally, asked investors to help them solve:*""If you are a data scientist interested in solving this kind of problem, get in touch with us!""*(It's no coincidence that the price dropped after that update, rather than increased)The team are winging it without a solid plan, and essentially ""making it up as they go along"", which they're passing off as adaptation.There's more going on behind the scenes than they're letting us know, and they're using a variety of delay tactics to drag things out as long as possible (e.g. beta access being slowly handed out)The one product/service that actually works is ICNP, because there's no technical obstacles in place with regards to investing in ICOs. However, the benefits this brings to ICN holders are uncertain right now, due to the sudden change in profit distribution which has been shown to be flawed by a number of people on reddit, and elsewhere.The fact most of the tokens are still on the ICO site is being touted as a good sign. It's not, and anyone with half a brain would be able to understand why.All in all, Iconomi is not shaping up to be the 'dream' we invested in several months ago, and has devolved into a much riskier token to hold.If the project was as good as its fans believe, and the team's attitude and decisions were met with the approval they seem to imagine, the token would already be at the $1 mark - easy.I don't think the team care about their investors. They're laughing all the way to the bank, while investors will be left holding useless ICN tokens."
4415,Mid,iconomi,"""This is crypto"" is just a void slogan, and doesn't mean people should be throwing money at everything carrying a crypto label without any kind of due diligence.Transparency toward stakeholders is a compulsory pre-condition in business. Trust is a personal choice and doesn't regulate anything.The figures you mentioned about exchanges are meaningless and out of scope. We are not talking about exchange regulation here, we are talking about shareholding and legally enforceable terms, more so if a company like ICONOMI promotes ICN tokens as shares. For that matter, I'm sure Poloniex or Kraken shareholders hold pretty solid terms from a legal standpoint.  I appreciate your enthusiasm in ICONOMI and I genuinely hope it will succeed eventually, but it's totally ungrounded and solely based on your legitimate personal beliefs.Fundamental facts like clear and legally binding terms and conditions are still missing. People should be warned about this instead of dreaming of 100% price increases."
4416,Mid,iconomi,"This is Crypto. And ICONOMI is a pionir in this business. 48% of small Crypto exchanges are no regulated and 65% large Exchanges are no regulated to. TRANSPARENCY and TRUST are the main regulator in CRYPTO. Investments in ICOs are more risky than average and you invest in things you think you can predict better.  I agree that in TRANSPERENCY and TRUST ICONOMI iconomi can become better.Probably you agree when ICONOMI increased confidence and transparency the price will be  100% higher at the moment."
4417,Mid,iconomi,">At this point it would be more valued for ICONOMI and token holders if there will be more people knowing ICONOMI and it's advantages. Here is our turn (token holders) to spread the words about ICONOMI and it's advatages.Are you suggesting that every ICN token holder should turn into an enthusiastic salesman and spread the word about how mind-blowing the ICONOMI project is? It's a safe and respectful assumption to believe that people are wise enough to evaluate investments with their own minds and wallets. People should be provided with *information*, not financial advertising.The FACT that 18 people are *trying* to add value for investors is something that should be taken for granted. Those same investors put 10M USD at stake.I for one think that with so many critical details still up in the air ICN 'disadvantages' largely outweigh advantages.I'm going to write a detailed post about it shortly. "
4418,Mid,iconomi,">Let be clear here, they have formed a company somewhere in the world where they all own equity in the company. You however with ICN have a claim on absolutely nothing.Everything comes down to this and should be stressed over and over.Committing the ICONOMI team to buybacks won't suffice, unfortunately. Clear legally binding terms regarding ICN tokens and their holders must be deployed. Otherwise the team will be just buying back a few worthless tokens whose market price only depends on flawed, distorted expectations void of any legal grounds whatsoever. "
4419,Mid,iconomi,I chuckled myself
4420,Mid,iconomi,"That doesnt make any sense.  Bitcoin has worth because its growing as an accepted form of payment.  Ethereum is a platform where the gas to transact on the platform is paid for by ether.  Both of these scenarios provide the coins with utility and fundamental value.  ICN has none of that.  It is completely disconnected from the platform.  The only thing that in theory could give it value is this buyback scheme, but as we are learning, there is absolutely nothing committing the ICONOMI team to honoring those buybacks going forward.  When confronted about this they are being shady about the whole thing (the private messages between me and jani are absolutely absurd, I really should post them) - I will say however that jani is just one guy on the team.  However, avoiding questions/this issue and putting the **wrong whitepaper** (not the one linked in the sale agreement) on their website is a huge red flag.  The coin is worthless as of now unless they come up with a solution.  Let be clear here, they have formed a company somewhere in the world where they all own **equity** in the company.  You however with ICN have a claim on absolutely nothing.One more thing that I will say is that although I will not own ICN as of now, I want the platform to succeed with flying colors.  If they provide that door for main street investors to pour money into alt coins, that is only going to raise my holdings in Golem, Factom, ETH, Ripple, Monero, etc.  Im rooting for them big time even though I dont believe in their coin as of now.  I REALLY hope they see this issue being discussed because I think providing a solution (if the whitepaper linked in the agreement is not the one on their website) is going to go a long way for their reputation and subsequent success. "
4421,Mid,iconomi,seems like you are the only one
4422,Mid,iconomi,"The excerpt from the white paper you just reported appears fuzzy and indefinite from a legal standpoint. This would be perfectly fine if we were talking about traditional corporate equity, where a general body of law exists and stock shares and shareholding are perfectly regulated, so everything left unexpressed traces back to the general corporate law.In crypto space such a regulation doesn't exist so everything must be clearly and positively detailed. For example, what is ICONOMI? Is it a company or a service? According to the white paper ""ICN tokens represent ownership of the ICONOMI **platform**, allowing their holders to receive dividends and vote on ICONOMI related issues"". A platform is a service, and a service doesn't pay dividends - only companies do.So what exactly an ICN token holder is? A shareholder of a company or a co-owner of a service? Legal implications are quite different for those two scenarios.Moreover: which are the legal binding terms enforcing the agreement obligations between the ICO issuer and the token holder, if any? How can *exactly* a token holder vote on ICONOMI related issues, and what is considered a ""related issue"" for that matter? Switching from dividend payments to token buybacks appears to me like a 'related issue' as it breaks a previous agreement. As well, choosing to spin-off a lucrative chunk of business and put it in a separate entity like Cofound.it seems just another 'related issue'. Yet, no vote ever took place on those matters.Re rights transfer, we can just *assume* that tokens work like shares, for lack of better details provided in the official papers. If so, then everything that comes with a share (including any form of right) is *generally* handed over to the new owner when you sell it to him. Again, question is: which are exactly those rights, if any, and what exactly your token represents in legal terms? "
4423,Mid,iconomi,The last one made me laugh.
4424,Mid,iconomi,"For at least the first 3+ years, the brand and the token's value is highly dependent on the teamOnly when a project becomes ""too big to fail"" by reaching a huge market cap like BTC or ETH are you protected from misbehavior by the core team leading to a big or total loss."
4425,Mid,iconomi,"Not really, once you get past the early stages the set up should always protect token holders.  For instance the Melonport coin will be integral to the platform which gives it value."
4426,Mid,iconomi,"> No, I do not trust an inner group of people for an indefinite period of time with tons of money especially when there is nothing legally to stop them from doing whatever they want.Could say the same thing about any ICO investment"
4427,Mid,iconomi,"Yeah so its a pretty big deal which one its referring to. You don't want to know if you have any rights as a token holder or if you are essentially holding nothing?  ""trusting the team"" is a bit of a joke.  No, I do not trust an inner group of people for an indefinite period of time with tons of money especially when there is nothing legally to stop them from doing whatever they want."
4428,Mid,iconomi,"ICNX is mentioned in both whitepapers, so ICONOMI.INDEX WHITEPAPER could actually refer to either whitepaper.You seem to be jumping to a lot of conclusions here.  If you are so concerned and don't trust the team, then just sell your tokens and move on.  There are 100's of crypto projects"
4429,Mid,iconomi,"Wow, what a scam.  So there are two white papers and the one that's included in the sale agreement has literally no language that says ICN token holders have any rights whatsoever.  Every token holder is holding absolutely nothing.  And yet they put the whitepaper that is not linked to the sale agreement and that conveniently does not have ""whitepaper"" in the title just so there is no confusion from a legal standpoind, on their fucking website, which does contain language about token rights, but is not binding because its not the whitepaper mentioned in the sale agreement, its the other one. Then they take the real whitepaper off their website.  Scam, this is it."
4430,Mid,iconomi,"How do we know which one the agreement points to?  If its the coinfundswhitepaper, there is literally nothing in here about ICN holders..."
4431,Mid,iconomi,Sell them to me!
4432,Mid,iconomi,">This was pretty mandatory for them ...Who is down voting this post? It's informative, well written, gives some background and proofs how utterly wrong and stupid I am.Seriously man, keep posting. That's some quality insight you give there."
4433,Mid,iconomi,Thanks for providing this.  Taking a look now.
4434,Mid,iconomi,"There are two different whitepapers, which used to be here before ethbuy domain was deprecated.https://ethbuy.iconomi.net/ICONOMI_Whitepaper.pdfhttps://ethbuy.iconomi.net/CoinFundsWhitepaper.pdf""CoinFundsWhitepaper"" is the one that went into detail about ICNX:https://www.docdroid.net/Gfdiq5A/coinfundswhitepaper.pdf.html"
4435,Mid,iconomi,Thanks for providing this.  Taking a look now.
4436,Mid,iconomi,"Not necessarily. Maybe those guys are just moving forward on a learn-by-mistake basis, as long as the ICO investors provided enough funds to foot the bill. Still sort of moral hazard if you wish: heads they/(everybody?) win, tails you lose. What is certain is they put themselves on a slippery slope legal-wise, wittingly or unwittingly. Seems like a gamble to push the envelope a bit too farther into unknown territory, for which token holders are literally left with holding the baby and taking all the risks on their own."
4437,Mid,iconomi,"take it to one of the legal advice subreddits, they would let you know"
4438,Mid,iconomi,">Because according to their own terms of service the icnx token and therefore also the performance fund, are neither investment tools nor should they be used as such. This by the way also renders the statement you were trying to make meaningless, because officially there's no investing with iconomi.This was pretty mandatory for them - I would have been astonished if they omitted to include such a remainder - otherwise they would have made countless infringements to any relevant financial regulation about public savings and the G-men would be already knocking at their door.This is the usual warning traditional finance has been using for decades, mainly to circumvent tricky licensing and investment soliciting issues."
4439,Mid,iconomi,"Depends what was in the token sale agreement.  The white paper was not part of the token sale and therefore has no legal grounds.  Either way im still not convinced that there is recourse here - especially considering the legal entity they formed is out of the jurisdiction of I would assume all token buyers. We should track down that language though if its available just to see, but given that their intent was to keep the token as far away from being labeled a security as possible, I really doubt it includes anything about: corporate ownership, profit sharing, voting rights, etc.  If all of this is absent from the sale agreement, congratulations, everyone is holding an empty bag dressed as tokens.  Donate them to your local chuck-e-cheeze because thats all the potential wealth generation they entitle you to."
4440,Mid,iconomi,"Do you have any legal recourse when you buy *ANY* service that says one thing but changes their terms without telling you? Of course you do.Crypto or not if you are told one thing and purchase it based off of those claims and those claims are not true, then you have a leg to stand on.Its just a matter of organization and fact finding if people were to go that route. Then a decent lawyer who is willing to work with everyone. In many countries crypto is considered legal tender or at the very least a commodity."
4441,Mid,iconomi,"really, man? here:a) I have a new account, which by the way is my only account, because I am knowingly and intentionally acting like a dick on the internet and my old account could be easily linked to my real name. I don't know of any group, so fuck of with your conspiracy shit.b) you fucking imbecile can not even read. the security op was speaking of, you troglodyte, is legal security or any other reason for you as an ICN holder to actually get paid. Because as it seems, you might as well be holding shit.I had written out a longer reply to you, but my computer crashed, and frankly I don't feel like writing it all anew. Look into my post history for some post where I asked some questions to a lawyer and read his replies. It's interesting as fuck and if you think it's all fud, just google it yourself. the following is bullshit and wrong:*oh, and by the way you retard, the 'random quote' maybe meant that I wasn't referring to the statement you were trying to make, but to your assumption that 'the idea behind iconomi is to bring money from traditional investors into crypto'. It's wrong. Because according to their own terms of service the icnx token and therefore also the performance fund, are neither investment tools nor should they be used as such. This by the way also renders the statement you were trying to make meaningless, because officially there's no investing with iconomi.*"
4442,Mid,iconomi,How is this workable from a legal standpoint when 1) tokens are not considered a **security** 2) no legal agreements were signed between token holders and the company (a white paper is **not** a legal agreement) 3) there is no legal infrastructure set up around crypto let alone to enforce anything.  We dont even know the country this company is incorporated in.
4443,Mid,iconomi,"Buybacks, not really sure, more legally binding would be dividends. Considering that is what was purchased."
4444,Mid,iconomi,"Being that you are buying something based on those words, yes of course. The fact that you bought with crypto makes it a *LITTLE* more sticky, but still completely workable from a legal standpoint. I would use a site like https://tlsnotary.org/ to make sure you get proof of all of those things with timestamps incase things get 'changed' as they can."
4445,Mid,iconomi,"These guys know damn well what they're doing.  Every day their representative Jani plays stupid the more of a scam this seems to be.  They dont give a flying fuck about the coinholders, they know they have the equity - the holdings that actually matter and give them actual **legal rights** to profits."
4446,Mid,iconomi,"Occam's razor principle applies. Putting as much space as possible between the ICN token and a full feathered security is a strong enough incentive to move from dividends to buybacks. Rather, it is baffling how little time they devoted to evaluating legal impacts of a dividend-paying token - assuming it wasn't an intended strategy. Their later turnaround towards buybacks made them appearing pretty amateurish in their approach to investors and short-sighted in their ability to properly plan corporate business stuff.They sit on a lot of money, true. But they *already* sit on it since when the ICO ended and they cashed in 10M USD to foot the bill for anything they are not legally bound to share with anybody. That's the bottom line and the main source of concern from a legal standpoint. Everything is tied to a promise and nothing more.People keep on insisting on those 13M reverse-vested tokens which should work as disincentive for the founders to walk away but they seems to me a bit overstated. At current ICN market price we're talking less than 6M USD on top of those 10M USD funds already cashed in. If ICONOMI team figures out a way to earn, say, 10x that money (and if you think there are many ways they could capitalize on their brand and market position) then 6M USD in missed capital gains represents an insignificant ticket price for such an outcome. Messing up the whole project becomes an economically efficient strategy, and an ICN token holder stands on a tricky territory on a legal basis to object to such a move. Something along those lines has already happened by launching their new Cofound.it project (for which they will be doing a new ICO and raising new funds shortly)."
4447,Mid,iconomi,"VERY good post zeqwox, thanks for this.  Theres a lot to think about.  My biggest concern is that when things are this in the air, big money will never move in to buy.  Holding ICN with this set up (lack of buyback robustness/legal protection) is going to be at the very least an emotional and volatile ride because it will be a constant push between greed and fear with no underlying certainty in the ""asset"" whatsoever.  The lack of token holder security through mechanics in place of the lack of legal protection is just not going to allow people to seriously invest in this.  For me (and im not telling anyone else to do) I sold today.  This is too sloppy for me to hold.  I hope they address this so I can get back in before launch.  Otherwise I will dedicate my money to platforms where the token is literally a necessary piece of the operation and therefore the value cannot be removed.  They build the platform and token completely segregated which was a mistake when legal protection for token holders is literally not even possible today."
4448,Mid,iconomi,"Dont spam the page with gems like ""ICNOMI is ISIS"" and ""Is Trident Stupid"" and you wont get removed as a spammer.  Uncensored means you get to say any opinion about ICONOMI, not spam the sub you little shit."
4449,Mid,iconomi,"thank you very much for your answer. Even as short overview without enough background to say things with certainty, it's a great help in assessing the possible risks associated with Iconomi Inc. and the ICN token for me (and I'm sure also everyone else who gets to read it.)I couldn't find either where Iconomi Inc. are incorporated. I had them confused there with Cashilla for some reason and thought up until now that they are 'based' in the Czech republic. The only thing I found on this topic was this post on reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/5vi3go/details_please_on_iconomi_inc/de2xpmi/I don't know whether I should be worried at how shady her reply is (afterall it's an investment you certainly want to fall under the radar of the law), but I think there might be a slightly higher chance for them to be based somewhere in the EU or an associated territory. (but that I only take from the fact that she used the term 'SPV', which says almost nothing, and that they are Slovenes and already have another eu-based business.) And there's also the possibility some other user brought up in that thread: They might not have incorporated at all. But that'd be crazy.>My guess is that at the end of the day ICN token is going to be considered a security by any court if, god forbid, things go sour with the ICONOMI project and people start losing serious money.> This is something an 'authority' is likely to see as a disproportionate and asymmetrical form of raising money with little or nothing in change - hence abusing public trust - and could charge the company with any kind of fraudulent allegation, possibly even a ponzi scheme.> general law principles still apply in full, so the argument äóìcrypto is not regulated and never willäó doesnäó»t work when it comes to financial criminal allegations.Thank you for clarifying this for me. This is what I was being afraid of.Assuming Iconomi has spoken to their lawyer about this, who most likely has told them the same or something very similar, I think it's safe to say they are operating under this very assumption or at the very least know it to be a probable possibility. *Thus they sit on a lot of money, and are afraid of the law and their own 'investors'.* That changes incentives a lot for them and hints at a motivation for the buyback built around legal considerations.*Edit: I'd like to stress that **the last paragraph is** completely speculative and should be treated as un**true and a conspiracy** theory at best.Edit II: Just to be clear. The bold stuff is a joke.  I was really speculating and there is no reason for anyone to assume that what I said is true."
4450,Mid,iconomi,"nice try.My reply referred to some ""hole in the security of ICN holders"" posted by one of your new accounts (yours or someone's else from the same group).**Of course there was no response about that, but quoting something irrelevant.**Last time we had a hole in the security it was with the DAO holding tons of money in a smart contract. How is that more secured?The closest time frame for something similar and decentralized is at least 2 years away ,and even then traditional investors will not take the risk with their customers money. So yes - Iconomi aims to bring part of that money into crypto, and your quote refers to ICNX, which is the first index fund. Iconomi is much more than that.Keep trying with the FUD"
4451,Mid,iconomi,"Those are good questions, and there are so many loose ends legal-wise it's quite difficult to sort them out if we are not provided with the full picture. Even in that case, your questions would command a full in-depth post just to give you some basic clues.For example, where has ICONOMI (the company) been incorporated? I haven't the slightest idea. Someone a few weeks ago mentioned they had set up an SPV for ICONOMI in some fancy caribbean island (ref. https://www.reddit.com/r/ICONOMI/comments/5vi3go/details_please_on_iconomi_inc/). If that is the case, then can be definitely tricky to seek court justice if something goes pear shaped. By not knowing what jurisdiction the company has been incorporated in - or even if an entity for the project really exists - you ignore which one relevant body of law actually applies, although most of the law principles are shared across all legislations around the world.Notwithstanding, so far ICN token is the closest thing to a security the crypto space has ever experienced. That was sort of revolutionary and one of the main ICN selling points too, and thrilled people (including me) quite a lot. Being so close to a security may cause some concerns and give ground to some pesky legal issues in the future. Does the simple fact they moved from a dividend-paying token to a buyback token remove those issues about ICN being a proxy to a security? Not at all. It only makes ICONOMI a bit less vulnerable on those allegations if someone eventually comes knocking at their door, along with relieving some pressure from exchanges who may consider ICN too hot to be listed.My guess is that at the end of the day an ICN token is going to be considered a security by any court if, god forbid, things go sour with the ICONOMI project and people start losing serious money. Otherwise I believe the token *could* keep on floating unnoticed and undisturbed in the crypto hyperspace as long as the ICONOMI team play their game fairly (not really the kind of trust bound you'd expect to see in cryptos) and until a regulator kicks in (likely from the USA).Still, the real issue with ICN tokens is they are a special form of unbalanced and asymmetrical shareholding, whose holders have no clearly depicted rights and legal binding and everything is messed up in the air. It counts for little if you had wittingly taken those risks when signing the ICO agreement. This is something an 'authority' is likely to see as a disproportionate and asymmetrical form of raising money with little or nothing in change - hence abusing public trust - and could result in charging the company with any kind of fraudulent allegation, possibly even a ponzi scheme. Donäó»t forget that even if crypto lacks a special tailor-made regulation, general law principles still apply in full, so the argument äóìcrypto is not regulated and never willäó doesnäó»t work when it comes to financial crimes allegations."
4452,Mid,iconomi,">FYI I am a full time lawyer in my everyday life.that's great. May I ask you some questions, because I don't want to spread unnecessary fud?If the icn token does not represent ownership anymore, am I right to say that people were swayed into investing under false pretence and does this imply a possible conflict with the law for the iconomi team? (given how they advertised their token with the following statement:100 % of the ICONOMI tokens represent 100 % ownership of the ICONOMI platform. ... in their white paper they even state that this includes all rights and liabilites, funds, trademarks yada yada ... which to me looks like it constitutes the whole company more or less)and if the token represents ownership, do you think it falls under the definition of 'security'?edit: by the way thanks for clarifying that the ICN token is not necessarily a share of the company."
4453,Mid,iconomi,"?"
4454,Mid,iconomi,"The white paper is all we have so far, and it has been rewritten/removed a few times already from their website. No other binding obligation whatsoever - assuming a white paper is an obligation (which is not).FYI I am a full time lawyer in my everyday life."
4455,Mid,iconomi,"Can you link me to a document on the iconomi website where I can read this up. I really looked for it, but could not even find the ICN token mentioned. (if it's in the whitepaper this might be fine, but I consider it somewhat outdated given how the payout of profits has changed.) I even asked an iconomi employee yesterday, but she did not answer me as of yet.  "
4456,Mid,iconomi,"It's worth repeating one more time that according to ICONOMI terms and conditions an ICN token holder is NOT an ICONOMI (the company) shareholder but rather - broadly speaking - a stakeholder in an ICONOMI project called ICONOMI and represented by ICN tokens.As such, he has no right whatsoever to (for example):-   vote to approve or dismiss any ICONOMI business proposal-   get a financial statement or be reported about ICONOMI business-   operate any form of control over ICONOMI costs-   legally claim any form of direct or indirect profit distribution-   prevent ICONOMI from diverting or 'spinning-off' chunks of lucrative business to other unrelated entities-   expect any form of 'care-taking' by the company with respect to token price and value"
4457,Mid,iconomi,"Token holders in the original white paper were told they would own 100% of the company and assets.  We are also promised buybacks at certain fee rates.  All I asked was 1) in what legal sense do Token Holders own the company, and 2) what is keeping the company to its promise tonbuy back shares moving forward.  I discussed this for a bit with some users, then was booted.  My posts and others were removed from r/ICONOMI bringing up the issues as well.  They think we are fools. Without any sort of arrangent that connects the token to the platform they are worthless.  If the company stops the buybacks, what are you going to do about it? - nothing.  There's a lot of money in this and people get greedy, ""trust us"" to do the right thing and do buybacks as long as the company exists is not good enough."

4464,Mid,iconomi,"That's a very good question everyone should be asking the iconomi team publicly in a space they can not control until they give a definitive answer.Because there's something very fishy about it, given how afraid they are of the word 'security'. When there's ownership involved, the ICN token is de facto a security (at least when you apply the investopedia definition found here: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) , which probably leaves them in legal troubles. Or there's no ownership involved in which case the ICN token is completely worthless, and they either scammed people during the ICO with false promises or they just expropriated their investors.I'm really hoping I'm completely wrong here.

4516,Mid,exscudo,When is the estimated date for the exchange to come online? 
4517,Mid,exscudo,I have some already through the ICO.  But obviously they are not trading yet. How would you transfer them?
4518,Mid,exscudo,How many do you want?
4519,Mid,exscudo,How many are you offering?
4520,Mid,exscudo,https://twitter.com/ex_scudo/status/877458713992470528
4521,Mid,exscudo,Source? Pretty sure it's up exchanges if they decide to even trade it.
4522,Mid,exscudo,In August
4523,Mid,exscudo,Excellent question! :)
4524,Mid,exscudo,I believe we need to wait for the test net to be done then they will launch the wallet for them. Not much you can do with them right now anyway.
4525,Mid,exscudo,"This was taken from Exscudo's Slack Channel, on June 1st:*TRADING OF EON COINS. The blockchain is not live yet. We will launch the test net in a couple of weeks. Then we'll look if there are any issues to fix and fix them. Only after that we will launch the EON blockchain. Then, any exchange will be able to list EON coins. The Exscudo exchange will trade EONs as well. It will be launched in Q3 2017.*"
4526,Mid,exscudo,"It could be even more depending on the Eon blockchain success and the Exscudo platform success in general, for instance, look at the example of Gnosis. During the ICO each gnosis had a value of 30 USD, when the blockchain was launched it was traded for a value near to the 80 USD and today (at the moment of writing this) each gnosis has a value of 262.79 USD, so if we are lucky maybe each EON will be priced higher than the ICO value, best luck :)"
4527,Mid,exscudo,"I think that it's true... (2.8571e-5 means 0.000028571 which is ten times more).So, in one hand, you will have cheaper EONs and in the other hand, you will have 7 times more EONs. And sorry if I'm wrong but, as I understand this, when the Exscudo exchange comes online the price of an EON will start at 0,0002 BTC. Probably after that, a lot of people will sell for profit and finally EON will get to an stable market price. But it's highly probable that it won't ever get lower than 2.8571e-5 BTC."
4528,Mid,exscudo,"The testnet will be launched in a couple of weeks after the ICO is finished. After the technology is tested and all issues are solved, the mainnet will be launched.The coins of the foundation will also be used for testing and development of new smart transactions, as well as for the launch of them into the network. They will be needed to run R&D, to integrate with new internal Exscudo services and external partners. In other words, they will be used for the development of Exscudo in any case. We believe that this is more advantageous for investors since it will enforce the development and testing processes.The language of EON is Java. However, users won't be able to upload any new smart transactions, since EON is not a fully open platform. Only the team can manage the smart transactions.Thank you for your interest! :)"
4529,Mid,exscudo,"The EON coins' main functions are technical. They are used for the interaction of Exscudo services, external services, smart transactions, testing, etc. We believe that investors will see the advantages of this, since such a system gives the team the possibility to develop, test and improve new services more quickly. As you have mentioned, the system is transparent."
4530,Mid,exscudo,"Yea, yea, I wanna buy some, too! :)"
4531,Mid,exscudo,"Thanks, the problem is the exchange (polo) is taking 24 hrs to process my withdrawels for some weird reason... Thanks sadly im going to have to miss the ICO :(:'( :'( :'("
4532,Mid,exscudo,"There isn't a testnet for the EON blockchain to test and develop new smart transactions in the future? Why does mainnet EON need to be used? Isn't this also, at least partially, the idea of the beta testing of the exchange? (which is on the timeline for 2017) Is mainnet EON used in the beta testing as well? How is it better to send the unsold coins to the foundation rather than the buyers? the more invested they are the more likely they will want EXSCUDO to succeed, right?Please don't take take these questions hostilely.  I am confident in the EON blockchain and the EXSCUDO team, however I would only like to understand these methods better.Sidenote: what language would be used for smart transactions? When testing comes around I would like to mess around with them a little bit and I want to familiarize myself with the language in the case I don't already know it."
4533,Mid,exscudo,"Sure, obviously there are ways to spend money on your product. My concern is that by allocating unsold coins to your non-profit, you have created an ICO structure that gives the developers more coins when investors buy less coins. It is transparent, but I'm not sure it's the right incentives."
4534,Mid,exscudo,"Hello! You can invest with ShapeShift using altcoins. If you use the Bitcoin blockchain, you can try to boost your transaction. After today 21:00 GMT we will stop accepting any payments."
4535,Mid,exscudo,"Hi! Thank you for the comment.We have conducted an ICO not only to fund the development of Exscudo products, but also to raise funds for the legal aspects of the project. The more funds are raised, the more money we can allocate in partner banks all over the world, and in the more countries we can get licensed in the nearest future. As for the foundation, it is a way to dispose of the unsold coins transparently. They can be used for tests and development of new smart transactions in future, for example. The EON blockchain is quite a complex thing that can make use of these coins for technical tasks.EON coins are not just assets, neither are they only a way to trade BTC and altcoins. Hence such a distribution."
4536,Mid,exscudo,Thank you.
4537,Mid,exscudo,"This is not correct. We do not collect, store or provide any private information about ICO participants. We even do not track where the transactions come from. For us, all investors are equal, and all will receive their coins."
4538,Mid,exscudo,"Hello! Do you have any specific questions?Our team is open: you can contact us on Facebook, bitcointalk or by email. As for the article, we have contacted the author and suggested conducting a skype call with our CEO for providing additional information about the project. However, the author didn't seem to be interested in more facts. Unfortunately.Concerning Facebook: there are many Bounty campaign participants who post comments. We do not limit the participation in the Bounty campaign for any user category, but we will moderate the participants after the end of the ICO in order to exclude bot accounts. However, we do not purchase any comments, because we do not see any purpose in doing this. :)"
4539,Mid,exscudo,Hello! We will look into the problem. Slack should be working correctly.
4540,Mid,exscudo,Hello! We use an own blockchain that is called EON. It is flexible and scalable. You can learn more in the technical white paper: https://exscudo.com/EON%20Whitepaper.pdf
4541,Mid,exscudo,Exactly. All investors will receive their EON coins.
4542,Mid,exscudo,"No one is going to lose his Bitcoins. All ICO participants regardless their citizenship will receive the purchased EON coins. We do not even track the origin of the investors technically, it is impossible to say if a transaction came from the USA or not."
4543,Mid,exscudo,"You will only be able to dispose of your EON coins after the blockchain is launched. EON coins will be traded on the Exscudo exchange and available in your Exscudo account. If any other exchange or service lists EON coins, you will be able to transfer them."
4544,Mid,exscudo,"Hello! According to the ICO agreement, a refund is impossible. https://exscudo.com/legal/#tab2"
4545,Mid,exscudo,"I cannot read this article, because I am not a gold member of that magazine (hacked.com). If it is allowed, would you please be kind to upload the article? I am seriously considering to invest into the Exscudo ICO, and would like to check this article before then.Thank you. "
4546,Mid,exscudo,Hi I have reached out to you guys a few times by email. I need to get my Bitcoin back I invested with you guys. I believe it will be a problem for me to invest with your company. 
4547,Mid,exscudo,"Why is nobody from Exscudo's team giving feedback on criticism and relevant questions that are coming up? I tried to join their Slack but it seems like they are not allowing anyone in.I just read the article linked in this post title and they come up with some pretty suspicious facts about Exscudo.Not only that but if you notice on their Facebook page, all the comments in their posts come from paid Malaysian and Indonesian users that have no idea what Exscudo is but just keep commenting ""Nice project"" and other random things...This is looking very shady, initially I was very excited with this ICO's but right now it looks like a trap.Can someone from Exscudo's team please clarify this?Thanks in advance!"
4548,Mid,exscudo,"From Katya on the Exscudo team in slack:  ""We have no special procedure for US citizens. However, we do not collect, store or show personal data of people who invest. In other words, we do not know if the transaction was from the USA or from France. And we do not provide any information to US authorities.""Meaning don't ask don't tell.  You should be fine if you invested already."
4549,Mid,exscudo,"Yes it's on this page https://exscudo.com/legal/Looks like U.S citizens getting the shaft as always. Maybe if you're in the U.S. you can get them dirt cheap and sell on an exchange.....""some day"" in the far future."
4550,Mid,exscudo,"Likely not a refund. Those screenshots I posted suggest that there is some way for US citizens to be included, although I couldn't find anything on it. Maybe the coins will be held on your exscudo account online until you can import the wallet into the channels app when released? Unless a mod says something we won't know until the release. I would send a help request from the website after logging in. I noticed that it was added as a tab this morning.Keep in mind that Exscudo is adamant about following laws because that is one of the things about its exchange that is meant to attract corporations to want to use it. Take for example bitlicences in the state of New York. I think there's only been about three filed. Something like ripple is friendly towards businesses and has its bitliscence in New York. Exscudo wants to be the exchange for both buisnesses and common people. A bitliscence in New York would take a large sum of the money raised in the ICO (I don't recall how much). And that is just the state of New York operating legally, for the federal government it would be even more costly. Exscudo will need to build  itself up financially outside the US before its able to enter the US market according to all laws. In the long term, by not operating in the US it lets Exscudo grow. ^ The reason I was specific about bitliscences is because I go to college in New York so I've studied a few of the laws having to do with cryptocurrency. I don't know a lot about it though, so again... It'd be great if a mod would chime in"
4551,Mid,exscudo,"That is besides the point. I've notice other investors trying to spin that answer and they don't answer the real pressing concern.  What happens to the coins that United State citizens invested into the ICO? Will United States citizens be issued EON tokens or will they receive a refund of Bitcoin?   "
4552,Mid,exscudo,"I wonder how many US citizens payed into the crowdsale and stand to lose their Bitcoins.  They should have posted this warning on the front page of the ICO, not hidden inside some legal notice. "
4553,Mid,exscudo,"Although, with more than 3500 BTC raised (look at their Development Plan) they will come to US. However, they will inevitably come to the US at some point. The legal expenses to operate in the US are too much for them while they are still developing I guess?"
4554,Mid,exscudo,from the Crowdsale Prospectus http://i.imgur.com/QjXE6RN.jpg http://i.imgur.com/JvL3UhB.jpg 
4555,Mid,exscudo,that sux
4556,Mid,exscudo,"wait what? why cant US citizens get exscudo?"
4557,Mid,exscudo,The exscudo legal documents clearly say that no one is allowed to participate in the ICO if they are a US citizen even though they let US citizens pay bitcoin into the ICO.  Biggest damn scam of all time.  There are going to be a lot of pissed off investors. 
4558,Mid,exscudo,Cashgrab
4559,Mid,exscudo,I'm wondering the same. I hope someone can explain it
4560,Mid,exscudo,To get quick response join EXSCUDO slack channel 
4561,Mid,exscudo,I did buy some.
4562,Mid,exscudo,It's still in ICO. Just go buy some: https://exscudo.com/ico/
4563,Mid,exscudo,"Well, I may be wrong, but I don't think that all the tokens you can hold in MyEtherWallet are based on Ethereum."
4564,Mid,exscudo,"EON is not based on Ethereum, so no."
4565,Mid,exscudo,"Exscudo have invested more than 4 million ""they say"" in tech. Can they show any evidence of this?"
4566,Mid,exscudo,You have a point there.
4567,Mid,exscudo,"I don't think it is, but the fact that no one is answering this question is bad news."
4568,Mid,exscudo,"No marketing plan = No visibility on how you scale in the future.No visibility = No data = No analysis for investors or users = No trust = No customers "
4569,Mid,exscudo,"Hello and sorry for the late answer,Yes, 76%, or to be more accurate, 74% of our funds will be spent on operational costs. However, such a big sum is not connected to any problems.Our system needs it in form of clearing funds, in other words, the money should be deposited in our partner banks, so our users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies fast and seamless.The bigger our clearing will be, the lower commissions we can set for our customers."
4570,Mid,exscudo,"JGriff1221, EON is dePOS, which means you don't have to use powerwul hardware to get commissions for transactions in the network. That's what concerns creating a peer: you need to have at least 25 000 EON deposited on the peer in order to get commissions.Besides, our exchange is designed a in way that allows miners to easily exchange your cryptos, you even don't need to enter the exchange - you may buy fiat right from your phone, using Channels:https://channels.exscudo.com/"
4571,Mid,exscudo,try asking on btt https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1781624.620
4572,Mid,exscudo,"That is a lot of text which doesn't tell me how I will be able to mine. I only have a few (15) gpu's going. Let me know ""how"" and I will give it a shot."
4573,Mid,exscudo,"No answer 15 days now, even more interesting"
4574,Mid,exscudo,Interesting question 
4575,Mid,aeternity,I would disagree. 
4576,Mid,aeternity,"TBH I think you're someone on the aeternity team lol. No one shills this hard RIGHT in the event of all the drama. Aeternity still hasn't made an official statement regarding the matter. Also why go through the trouble of making another account to hide your identity? Could be wrong, but either way you're shitty and I hope you as an individual get burned. "
4577,Mid,aeternity,Best time to fork.
4578,Mid,aeternity,And why are you here?
4579,Mid,aeternity,"Um, still huh.If aeternity succeeds, its investors succeed.I'm interested in not only seeing my investment do well, but those of my fellow investors too.  This isn't a zero sum game; for me to ""win"", others don't have to lose."
4580,Mid,aeternity,shill
4581,Mid,aeternity,Have fun with that ae classy classic doing everything yourself zachyo
4582,Mid,aeternity,"Thanks for sharing your perspective.  I am not an attorney, but have been through many legal negotiations and I think what I said on other threads is consistent with this.  Agorist or not, Zach should have consulted with counsel before posting a line of code on github."

4584,Mid,aeternity,shill?
4585,Mid,aeternity,Thanks pops
4586,Mid,aeternity,"Screw it. Just so you'll believe me, this is all I see: https://i.imgtc.com/Obz0URR.pngThere is only **one** set of keys, and it's not for the child address generated by the wallet.I have no idea how to unlock that address, and now, actually, after upgrading Jaxx, all my transaction history has disappeared as well. WTF. EDIT: And yes, that's exactly what I already imported into MEW, and yes, my AE balance was shown as 0."
4587,Mid,aeternity,Aeternity forking before it even gets released. Ain't that some shit. 
4588,Mid,aeternity,Ae tried to help Zach but ae had no doctorate
4589,Mid,aeternity,"That and the fact that Zach is way more concerned with talking about the money he thinks he's owed, selling zero day exploits and starting Amoveo than seeking justice or protection from the ""assault""."
4590,Mid,aeternity,Superstition and religion has killed many people such as Bob Marley
4591,Mid,aeternity,"See my response above. If you need a screenshot, I'll provide it, so you can see exactly what I'm seeing."

4593,Mid,aeternity,Fool me once...can't get fooled again
4594,Mid,aeternity,Because he's already contributed what he wanted?
4595,Mid,aeternity,Aeternity contributors are made up of a lot of informed people. Despite this total shit show I think there's enough money and enough experience to work from the original vision and make something of value. Bare minimum gonna be a nice pump.
4596,Mid,aeternity,"There is a private and a public key in display, but ONLY for the original wallet itself. "

4633,Mid,aeternity,"Even by Zack's own words, AE didn't have a problem finding a lawyer to represent them.  They are incorporated in Switzerland, right?"
4634,Mid,aeternity,"Well you aren't a fucking lawyer!""It's illegal to ever talk negatively about a publicly traded company, if it affects their share price? Quite interested to hear where this fascinating country is in which you're practicing law.""It's libel to claim you were assaulted by your boss if you weren't.  It's libel to claim a person (Yani) did things which didn't occur if your intent is to damage that person's reputation or harm a person or business related to him.So yeah, unless Zack was 100% speaking the truth, he's massively fucked.Shareholder suits too.  If I can show that Zack was not telling the truth, I could file suit against him for fucking over my investment.Don't confuse ""tiny person on the internet slagging off a massive corporation and nothing happens because it's not worth it"" with ""tiny person is entitled to say what he or she wants with no consequences"".Zack trashing aeternity isn't the same as ""random dude saying his Big Mac sucked"".  In the latter, the person is safe because there's no expectation that damage will occur.  In the former - especially when Zack.explicitly stated he was willing to sell zero day exploits - it's kind of a big deal.BTW, since this shit started, I've been archiving Zack's posts.  He's edited them significantly since, but I'm happy to provide my copies plus chain of custody and immutable timestamps to anyone who needs it."
4635,Mid,aeternity,Your assumption shows ignorance but you seem like a good guy. Thanks
4636,Mid,aeternity,"Ownership and control are different, but, I see your point.  Most of the team has a stake on those tokens and are the rightful owners. Robbery it is not"
4637,Mid,aeternity,"Yeah, from what I've read, Zach doesn't give two shits about his reputation. You don't go apeshit on a public forum accusing people of assault and then threatening to hold code hostage if you don't get paid the amount you want if you actually care about your rep."
4638,Mid,aeternity,You have no idea what I am.
4639,Mid,aeternity,"I could see it being an issue with blockchain. The whole ""borderless"" part would be hard to take steps in. He shouldn't have needed to to begin with though. Topcuck."
4640,Mid,aeternity,"This sounds infinitely more likely than Zach's unhinged rant about foreign countries, bribed officials, assaults, injured legs, and flights from danger. Sorry, Zach. I wish you well, and will happily support you if you're proven right.But seriously, grow up."
4641,Mid,aeternity,The fact is that Zack did not take steps in advance to protect his own interests.   Isn't that the definition of a cuck?   
4642,Mid,aeternity,"wasn't trying to argue. was just telling you you're a cuck. "
4643,Mid,aeternity,If it is determined that Zach is either an employee or partner of Aeternity then he has a duty of care that would put him at risk of damages resulting from his actions. You aren't a lawyer.
4644,Mid,aeternity,"Your perspective is 100% clear and inline with reality. Aeternity has counsel and listens to counsel.. clearly. Which like you say, is why zach is fucked."
4645,Mid,aeternity,Haha I remember nothing of the sorts. I did sign for a decoy the other day...I will keep you in mind thanks!
4646,Mid,aeternity,But he stayed on incurring debt to Aeternity? He's not owed anything while raising red flags and not working building value in Aeternity. So how is he owed 3 million? For what?
4647,Mid,aeternity,"No, a photo is not ""open source"".  If there is misrepresentation of your involvement with a project or company, you have to act immediately in your interest, or it can be construed as implied consent."
4648,Mid,aeternity,It's a common misstep by the inexperienced to avoid formalization of agreements and contracts. It's a stupid mistake that always ends up like this. 
4649,Mid,aeternity,"Teaching me how to spend my free time will not change anything.The Pandora box was open and you should not expect there are many idiots left.Everyone is waiting to dump, no matter what they write here."
4650,Mid,aeternity,Such a cogent argument...
4651,Mid,aeternity,"Yeah, they replaced all his code in few days.  LOL"
4652,Mid,aeternity,"Zack clearly and repeatedly raised many red flags before the ICO began. For example, this thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/62yrhs/thoughts_on_the_%C3%A6ternity_crowd_sale/What's more, real investors e.g. VCs wouldn't even make the excuse that they weren't alerted to the lack of proper incentives and agreements being in place -- These factors are among the few things that VCs are expected to proactively get information on themselves, even if the team does not offer this information willingly, or else refuse to make the investment at all."
4653,Mid,aeternity,"Thank you, someone who I'd probably happily defend, judging by your name!"
4654,Mid,aeternity,"I agree, but Zack also had a responsibility to raise red flags before the ICO if he knew things were amiss (as did aeternity as a whole).  Investors can do all the research in the world, but if things are hidden away, we're kinda at the mercy of the project.I'm not worried.  Zack isn't as key to the success of aeternity as his ego thinks.  Push on, fix this shit, and make it work.  If he was irreplaceable, we wouldn't be in this mess now.Fortunately, Zack seems to have moved on.  Sadly, there's a hoard of teenage boys who have nothing better to do than get themselves off on smashing other people's shit up."
4655,Mid,aeternity,"not to stir controversy, but basically to defend the company, very suspicious behavior to say the least."
4656,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, that's what I could not make my mind around too.Even if Zack was totally incompetent and the code needed to be re-factored from scratch, still 3 million is very low price to keep his mouth shut and avoid much bigger losses.It does not make any sense unless you don't give a fuck about the project at all and plan to cash out as soon as possible (or already did)."
4657,Mid,aeternity,"You again?  Why are you here?If you've invested, you're a fool for harming your own investment with FUD.If you didn't, you're a fool for wasting your life on the internet in things that don't concern you.Get outside.  Go have coffee with a friend.  Go play a sport.  What a pathetic existence trolling is.  I feel sorry for you.  Life is precious.  Get one."
4658,Mid,aeternity,"> But aeternity would have a valid counterclaim for harm from Zack's outburst - the drop in expected value of aeternity - which experts could put a price on. And that's waaaaaay more than three million.It's illegal to ever talk negatively about a publicly traded company, if it affects their share price? Quite interested to hear where this fascinating country is in which you're practicing law.> What laws were broken here?Highly jurisdiction specific, of course, but at a minimum, yani opened himself up to obvious liability by refusing to pay any wages. Note that a written employment contract is not at necessary in creating an employer / employee relationship in the US. The EU countries, of course, are often less favorable to the employee in these cases. Here's the US:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment#United_States> regarded as employees for the purpose of discrimination laws if they work for the employer on a regular basis, and said employer directs the time, place, and manner of employment."
4659,Mid,aeternity,"Well, the dude lost it all, doubt he cares for anyone's tokens value.They hurt him, he tries to hurt them back as much as he can too.Fair play to him."
4660,Mid,aeternity,"Indeed, this will be an extremely unpopular opinion here, but -- the AE investors share a massive portion of the blame here. Sophisticated investors go to great lengths to ensure that the key members of the team are committed emotionally, incentives wise, and legally, before investing. Did the AE investors ever stop to ask themselves - are we funding who we think we're funding? The AE team, including zack, was quite transparent at ICO time, that zack had little formal connection to the project at all.  The AE investors failed here badly, and unfortunately now they may suffer losses because if their failure."
4661,Mid,aeternity,"Fully agree with you here, no two opinions on the above.Problem is that Zack claim for  3 million seems totally reasonable given his involvement in the project so far. And seems Eternity is not disputing there was such demand from Zack.No idea why his request was not met. As you say getting him on contract for 3 million would have prevented much bigger losses for the company.  Very short sighted decision by Yani or whoever is the real owner to rock the boat for such an amount. After all this new Joel Reymont guy will probably cost more in the long run.Of course if we are in for a long term development at all."
4662,Mid,aeternity,Lmao imagine being this delusional
4663,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, it is strange why Zack as lead (and seems the only) developer did not negotiate to secure % of the tokens in advance before the ICO launch. The story is so funny indeed, no idea how this circus managed to get so much backers."
4664,Mid,aeternity,Thank you Mr.Lawyer
4665,Mid,aeternity,"The foundation owns 100% of the received ICO BTC & ETH, yani owns 100% of the foundation."
4666,Mid,aeternity,The foundation has 17% of all tokens so it is not like Yani is a dictator
4667,Mid,aeternity,"People don't seem to understand that Yanislav is the genius here.  Zack might be a good coder with good ideas (and a foul temper), but he's no misunderstood Buterin or Satoshi."
4668,Mid,aeternity,"I would still sell it really is not that big of a bath.  But, yeah, i (i never miss an opportunity to say thanks ae) think they did us a favor. Some sellers will sell in any market. They may be fools on a surfboard trying to ride a tsunami but there are plenty of big yacht buyers to help out "
4669,Mid,aeternity,"Speaking as a lawyer (yep, a real one):Zack has fucked himself with his statements thus far.  Competent opposing counsel would destroy him on the stand based upon what he's wrote and how his story changes by the day.  Easy to paint him as, well, dishonest.I sincerely - truly sincerely - doubt that aeternity doesn't have a detailed record of their interactions with Zack, especially towards the ugly ending.  Zack, like you astutely point out, clearly likes to play by his own rules (noble as they may be), but sadly everyone else abides by the law.  And if he wants to seek compensation via the law, ""agorism"" isn't gonna fly.  What laws were broken here?  Who was harmed?  What is the harm caused?  Who tried to mitigate the damage?  That'll all be determined by a judge who applies real world law, not cryptoworld agorism.Working without a formal arrangement is stupid.  He should have known better, and any reasonable participant would have nailed this core agreement down early on, not waiting until the last minute then crying on Reddit.If I was a judge: yes, Zack is owed his three million.  But aeternity would have a valid counterclaim for harm from Zack's outburst - the drop in expected value of aeternity - which experts could put a price on.  And that's waaaaaay more than three million.Zack would be smart to walk away quietly, learn his lesson (again), and move on.  His damage to aeternity is far greater than aeternity's damage to him.  If he wants to go down the legal route, fine.  But he needs to be prepared for a hollow victory in court followed by a judgment against him for tens of millions of dollars.Also, aeternity has kept quiet, sensibly preventing any libel.  If what Zack wrote isn't flawlessly true and it harmed aeternity as a result (which it did - maliciously so), he'd better be worried about being sued for libel."
4670,Mid,aeternity,Go to police because somebody bitch slapped or kicked you?  You think any policeman will take that seriously and you can have a case?
4671,Mid,aeternity,"So seems the only true blockchain developer that was working on the project for the last 12 months was some incompetent and mentally unstable dude who was only kicked out because he got into disagreement over money with the team lead / company owner.Nice project management indeed!Seems if the incompetent loon did not start asking for his part of the millions, they would have allowed him to keep running the show as CTO.LOL"
4672,Mid,aeternity,"So on what grounds is Yani the sole owner of the project when admittedly the original idea and all the programming so far was made almost exclusively by Zach.It looks like daylight robbery to me."
4673,Mid,aeternity,"Sorry, thanks. "
4674,Mid,aeternity,"Minor correction- it was yani, not vlad, who drove all of ae's legal decisions and maintained 100% ownership and control over the foundation that owns everything ae (excluding AE tokens sold to the public in the ICO).The obsession over legalities is a bit much as well. Enforcing cross-country legalities, for hyper-mobile people like these, with no home ownership or regular day job income - is incredibly useless. E.g. CA USA especially, where zack could easily relocate to, makes far less use of contracts for employment agreements for working out employment relationships than anyone from elsewhere might think. Loosely speaking, things like non-competes and good will clauses are effectively unenforceable - except in the case of signing those away in exchange for proceeds from an exit event in which the party owned >= 10% of the company.Legal measures being ineffective is the way it has to be for blockchain projects though. Trust me, you want that to be the case -- or else killing blockchains would be completely trivial for any govt!"
4675,Mid,aeternity,lol shut the fuck up. 
4676,Mid,aeternity,"No he did a bunch of work without signing anything, then retroactively wants 10% of the pot for it.When offered 1% (which is still a fuckload of money for a few months work since aes inception i might add) he refuses to sign and threatens to essentially destroy ae by selling zero day exploits whilst making and pushing his own new code. Basically holding AE code ransom for 3 mil.I would like to say now as well i dont feel comfortable with 10% of the pot for building ae to go to any one person. It should be for long term project costs. Being the inventor of an open source app doesnt immediately give you the right to demand 10% of its profit.Zack, best of luck but YOU SHOULD HAVE AGREED TO AND SIGNED CONTRACT.In regards to the assault etc i personally think if the claim is genuine the police should be informed. Its nothing to do with us though."
4677,Mid,aeternity,"LOL, Thank PBOC!!!"
4678,Mid,aeternity,"I agree he seems like a lone wolf. It is amazing he lasted so long at aeternity. At least he seems to love the tech, although i do not mean to defend him"
4679,Mid,aeternity,"Sounds shit to be honest. I guess people who are interested can help him code Amoveo.. Because he says he doesn't ""want responsibilities or obligations to investors or anyone"". He really shouldn't be working with anyone. Clearly there are some issues there."
4680,Mid,aeternity,Opensource isn't it?
4681,Mid,aeternity,No the one and only test net is based largely on Zach's work as far as I understand it
4682,Mid,aeternity,"First this guy says he's the only developer on the team and the whole project is based on his code, now he says he was just a junior developer and didn't like being viewed as the technical lead. "
4683,Mid,aeternity,"I've already explained the ""limitation"" to you (and how Zack has twisted it), so please don't continue to post things that make it sound like a technological defect.I'll explain again:It appears that dishonest Zack has been editing his ""confession"", as the description of the limitation was in his piece earlier. Either that or he described it elsewhere.Basically, Yanislav didn't want off-chain state channels being used to create financial derivatives. Zack (probably correctly) told him this was impossible; after all, it'd be like a gun manufacturer saying that their product is not to be used for murdering people, or a car manufacturer saying it didn't want the cars to be driven by bad drivers or drunk people. It's impossible to control once the product is made and sold. A blockchain is a platform, and once it's released into the wild, it's pretty much out of the hands of the creator as to how it's used too.  Yanislav wanted the ""limitation"", and it can't be done.So the ""limitation"" isn't actually a limitation, but rather a widening of the scope of uses for aeternity.By now, haven't we all learned that when Zack says something, we can generally assume it's ambiguous at best, and likely twisting the truth?"
4684,Mid,aeternity,The one not based on his code?
4685,Mid,aeternity,Unless there is a technical limitation Zack is attempting to cover with this horseshit. One he is ashamed of because it reflects back on his own failure.. which prompted him to run away.
4686,Mid,aeternity,Absolutely. All part of the pump and dump cycle. This controversy is good for the initial pump and dump. Pump this biatch!!
4687,Mid,aeternity,The testnet runs well soooo....Zach can just buzz off and get a life
4688,Mid,aeternity,I am starting to hate this guy.
4689,Mid,aeternity,Maybe
4690,Mid,aeternity,I do not believe this. It makes no sense for Yani to assault Zach
4691,Mid,aeternity,Limitation as in his code should be completely scrapped because it sucks?
4692,Mid,aeternity,"We dont know what happened, and TBH it doesnt really matter who did what to who.All we know is Zack got in a spat with AE over money. If he wants to take assault accusations seriously, go to the police; dont just post it on github. This is nothing to do with the project and is a personal matter IMO.Secondly, yes Zack did ""invent the code"" but this was not patented technology was it? This was posted on Github yes? So its open source. So in the end of the day, he is pissed off someone has picked up his open source code and is not paying them for it. Surely you dont make your code public if you dont want people to use it for nothing.He is just as bad as those he is accusing of malpractice if he intends to screw over 5000+ independant investors just to hurt the founder of aeternity... When he could just take him to court for assault and theft of intellectual property if he has a claim.In the end of the day, on this letter, he seems to be just saying he thinks he deserves A,B,C for doing X,Y,Z.But he never signed a contract - this is extremely basic stuff! Never drop everything and do work for someone based without an agreement in writing."

4694,Mid,aeternity,Perfectly explained 
4695,Mid,aeternity,Are YOU skilled enough to debug Zack code? Just asking

4697,Mid,aeternity,"Move on like hiring some blockchain noobs to take off from here and make it work, when the original inventor and blockchain expert says the technology has limitation and can not work?"
4698,Mid,aeternity,So air your concerns by selling as soon as you're able.  Job done.
4699,Mid,aeternity,"Ok.  It appears that dishonest Zack has been editing his ""confession"", as the description of the limitation was in his piece earlier.  Either that or he described it elsewhere.Basically, Yanislav didn't want off-chain state channels being used to create financial derivatives.

4704,Mid,aeternity,"Well, can you describe this ""technical limitation""?"
4705,Mid,aeternity,"Moving the tokens has been explicitly disabled by the Aeternity team's smart contract, so people can't move the tokens unless they allow it."
4706,Mid,aeternity,"He probably likes to get kicked by the eternal godfather.How come Zack not appreciate the holy kick that was so generously granted to him. "
4707,Mid,aeternity,I haven't tried to move my tokens but I assume you should now be able to do it through MEW. Have you tried?
4708,Mid,aeternity,Did Zack apply to police or else legal action? If no why discuss it?
4709,Mid,aeternity,"Spot on, most commentators are like ""shut the **** up until I manage to dump my tokens""  LOL"
4710,Mid,aeternity,"I doubt Marion is still not paid.  She seems just an ordinary girl with not any special skills and should not be expensive.  That Bulgarian founder godfather dude can not be that stupid, he needs the rest of the team to remain in his boat, so probably Marion got a good deal already."
4711,Mid,aeternity,"Ok, then they stole his IP and he wasn't really an employee.  What's the date of the filing with the court to get AE to take his picture off of the website?  "
4712,Mid,aeternity,"I have no idea if Zack's claims are valid.  There's just his word on Reddit and github.  Neither reddit nor github is going to get him an inch closer to a satisfactory settlement or compensation for work performed.A mature, responsible adult would ensure that legal structures protecting him and his work are in place before any work is done.It sounds like AE management didn't hesitate to hire an attorney.  So why didn't Zack do so?  What he posted on Reddit would work strongly against him in any negotiation, let alone litigation."
4713,Mid,aeternity,"Very well said, but thing is nobody cares.  Most of the ""investors"" are here for the hype and the inevitable pump and dump anyway. Zack just seems too naive, he still thinks they are actually planning to have any workable product.  LOL"
4714,Mid,aeternity,"Totally hollow and empty promises, the last refuge of bag holders and shills"
4715,Mid,aeternity,"It seems to me that Zack didn't value his own work enough to secure his legal rights to it.Regardless, it sounds like they are not using his code."
4716,Mid,aeternity,"For an anarchocapitalist who develops systems to enable trustless financial transactions, Zack puts a lot of faith into the inherent goodness of other people and implicit contracts that offer him no legal protection.   He made his IP publicly available and someone came along and made it into a commercial venture.  I know that anacaps don't believe in IP, but that isn't the world we live in.  He didn't have an attorney argue on his behalf, instead taking his petty disagreements public and expecting the heckler's veto and outright extortion threats to work to his benefit.He didn't believe in the ICO, and didn't even want it to be a commercial venture in the usual sense.  He evidently couldn't work with others, couldn't lead a team.  He stuck to his guns on his original vision and didn't listen to or care what anyone else thought.   Was Zack jilted?  I use that term because, like a romantic affair, Zack had no formal legal protection or written contracts protecting the IP.  It comes down to he said-she said.  If Zack is right, he should hire an attorney to argue for his legal rights and follow his attorney's advice to the letter ( the first advice would probably be, ""shut up"")."
4717,Mid,aeternity,They formed the entire company and ICO based on his work. I would say he is indeed the critical employee. The fact that they have stolen his work and kicked him out of the company without paying for it says volumes about the company. This is not a company anyone should invest a dime in.
4718,Mid,aeternity,Somebody please report OP to the cops. He sounds like a deranged lunatic out of his mind because his investment has faltered.
4719,Mid,aeternity,This no-name company comprised of a couple of individuals is hosting an ICO completely based off of his work and you don't think he should demand a founder's cut? You pussies who lick your boss's butt all the time because you think anything you demand would be a career killing move is the reason why employers take talented coders for a ride.
4720,Mid,aeternity,I wouldn't go as far as this other guy but CTO/foundation and infrastructure of your business model is not somebody you want to fuck with/over.
4721,Mid,aeternity,"> Yeah, great career move.Lol when you have talent, you don't need a ""career"". People will run after you to make money off your expertise. This is something many talented people don't understand and are ultimately taken advantage off. Software industry is a bit like the music industry. The actual talented people who do all the work and create something of value are taken for a ride by parasites who do nothing but leech money off those talented individuals."
4722,Mid,aeternity,He did good. You are looking out for your own selfish interest. He is also looking out for his own interest. Touche!
4723,Mid,aeternity,"You are all selfish people. You don't care what happens behind the scenes. You don't care if some talented dev's work is being ripped off by a company without paying dues. You don't care that a dev has been physically attacked and is running for his life. You only care about the profits. You want a ""clean"" launch so you can dump this useless coin on some greater fool who may be stupid enough to buy this coin."
4724,Mid,aeternity,"MyKryptoCunt, why are you such a cunt?"
4725,Mid,aeternity,"If he really is talented enough to develop blockchain projects on his own, why should he sign standard employment agreements that pay him a standard salary? He is better off starting his own company and hiring some PR/Management guy on a retainer to manage the project."
4726,Mid,aeternity,"Ray Kroc was a parasite, nothing more. He benefited off someone's else idea and hard work without paying his due to them. He literally scammed the McDonald's brothers. No person with morals will ever call Ray Kroc a legend nor put him up on a pedestal."
4727,Mid,aeternity,They are using his work without paying or crediting him and you are fine with that? Crypto was invented to weed out leeches and middle men who want to control all the money without doing any work and give power back to the people who actually do the work that brings value to the system.
4728,Mid,aeternity,"Employer? lol.A tech startup with zero developers in the team hires a talented dev and he becomes an 'employer' worthy of respect even though he withholds his pay and physically beats him up? I am glad he went public on social media and tarnished this 'employer's' name. Good on him.You guys are selfish lunatics and only care about what effect the story will have on the price of the coin. Hope the coin finds itself amongst the rubble soon enough."

4742,Mid,aeternity,AE Is going to pump to 10. Gonna be good.
4743,Mid,aeternity,"I hung out and worked a bit with Zack when he was working on Flying Fox. Aeternity was just a rebrand of the ideas he was working on since 2014/2015. I didn't invest in the ICO in early 2017 because the other people involved had a scammy vibe (""the godfather of Ethereum""????) and Zack himself seemed unsure of the arrangement. I'm guess your main qualification here is as an Aeternity bag holder."
4744,Mid,aeternity,Yes people are just putting their orders on the books in the hopes of getting cheap tokens. None of this matters until trading starts.

4771,Mid,aeternity,Which exchanges? We ae about to dns the poop out of them
4772,Mid,aeternity,It depends when you contributed. 650 to 1100 ae per ether
4773,Mid,aeternity,All good. Can you tell me how many AE I should expect to be there for every ETH invested (ballpark). Then I can also check if I have the right amount.
4774,Mid,aeternity,I agree
4775,Mid,aeternity,"Steps are being taken. It does not make sense to do it all at once, but rather in quick succesion"
4776,Mid,aeternity,Yay 6 posts. 
4777,Mid,aeternity,Is this sub sanctioned by the ae foundation or is it rogue?
4778,Mid,aeternity,If valuation gets that high the community will probably curb it with inflation to balance the security of the network and make the chain better overall.  Most will probably be happy with gains at that point and will want to start thinking about long term growth instead of price jumps and trading
4779,Mid,aeternity,You do realize that Aeternity isn't responsible for their tokens being listed on exchanges right? They have nothing to do with that and they are separate entities.
4780,Mid,aeternity,It is certainly possible: No hardcap on token valuation
4781,Mid,aeternity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aeternity_trader/
4782,Mid,aeternity,Thank you this are reasonable numbers and honest answer. 
4783,Mid,aeternity,"Do we have a AE Trader Subreddit?, is $200 in 1-2 years something possible?, thanks. "
4784,Mid,aeternity,"isnt Hitbtc a exchange?, I remember buying SONM as IOU tokens on Liquid and when tokens were distributed my IOU Tokens became real tokens, pretty sure same thing will happen with AE on Hitbtc. Just my 2Cents."
4785,Mid,aeternity,"Disagree. We all know there was a troublesome time in the dev-team. So the release of tokens is a first step to show things are going forward. Exchanges will come. Considering the recent issues, in my opinion it is excusable that not everything happens the same time as we all wished for, but happens nonetheless."
4786,Mid,aeternity,"And:""Zack Hess quit after a) not signing a standard employment agreement...""Looks like Zack has a history of 'employment issues'.  First with Augur, now with aeternity.  This is a common theme.  One employment issue is understandable.  Twice in a row and we can start to see a pattern."

4794,Mid,aeternity,R2d2? Yam skywalkerkoosh
4795,Mid,aeternity,Actually you are right. Zack wasn't an employee and that is what this drama is all about. Aeternity is rewriting history by asserting NOW that he was never anything but an employee. 
4796,Mid,aeternity,You already did invest in that person unless I'm missing something.
4797,Mid,aeternity,true.
4798,Mid,aeternity,haha you already did give him your money. Who did you think you gave it to when you invested? Who wrote the whitepaper? Wrote all the original code from which the entire value proposition was based on? Clearly you didn't do any DD. And now you are angry. It's your own fault.
4799,Mid,aeternity,Creation is only the first step. We are very close to transferability
4800,Mid,aeternity,So close yet so far...i cannot wait! Better than christmas
4801,Mid,aeternity,I think I lost mine. I made my wallet through the wallet on the aeternity site and sent my ethereum now its saying that the aeternity wallet has a different address from the myetherwallet I created and I don't have any way to access it. I have the address and can see the AE in there but only have the private key for myetherwallet :(
4802,Mid,aeternity,There is no such thing as an absolutely critical employee.  
4803,Mid,aeternity,"Later today, read the release..."
4804,Mid,aeternity,"What is the purpose of creating this token if you cannot send them to other wallets? That means we have to wait for teh Mainnet Lauch before any exchange will add this token for sure, right?"
4805,Mid,aeternity,"There are almost 200 million tokens. I  would not hold my breath for $200. And it would have to take over Ethereum, NEO, etc. Maybe in a few years, but I would look for $5 within 1 year, if LUCKY. Patience is key, the space is a little baby. Expect 10X gains next year... again."
4806,Mid,aeternity,I got mine
4807,Mid,aeternity,"I'll be holding too, after looking at your profile it seems that you know way more than me about AE and crypto in general. I'm planning to HOLD for 2 years, I do not need to sell them. If it possible for Aeternity to reach $200?, when I invest into it was on a tip, I remember the person telling me just buy and sell at $5. But, I've sell many coins which i regretted selling and AE feels like a solid Hold. I didnt know about the Zack thing thought. Thank you in advance. "
4808,Mid,aeternity,You can't send. You can't trade. Enjoy. Well done I agree.

4813,Mid,aeternity,"I use Mist.  I have the private key for my account, which I do not keep in an electronic file on my computer.I can access that same account in MEW, Parity, or Metamask."
4814,Mid,aeternity,Just scroll through r/Aeternity 
4815,Mid,aeternity,He used to be a member of Augur 
4816,Mid,aeternity,What was Zack's first project that went sour?
4817,Mid,aeternity,"This makes no sense.  Did they hold a gun to his head while they forced him to agree to give up tech in exchange for tokens?  Did they tie him to a chair until he signed a completely one-sided contract?Zach's story doesn't pass the smell test. "
4818,Mid,aeternity,"That's different from actively selling zero-day exploits.Did you have an employment contract that you think they breached?  You said elsewhere that you're not a lawsuit kind of guy.  Instead you're implying that you're a ""two wrongs make a right"" sort of guy.  That's sad."
4819,Mid,aeternity,"Would you seriously invest in a platform where one of, or the key developer has caused such a bad perception of his previous company without caring for all the contributors that are not at fault of whatever disagreements he had with his employer? For all I know that guy would do the same thing whether he has 0 , 10 or 100% control of the funds.Hard to trust someone that is destroying his own reputation by publicly displaying his tantrum and threatening the investments of all the contributors"
4820,Mid,aeternity,I got mine
4821,Mid,aeternity,ps. upvoted this thread bc. constructive questions like these are good for others that were also wondering the same thing.
4822,Mid,aeternity,Indeed most likely there will be a contract on My Ether Wallet where you can register your ETH address(es) that hold AE. It can be pretty easy for us users. Maybe you are even given a freshly generated Aeternity mainnet address and priv.key at that point. Its all possible and done before. 
4823,Mid,aeternity,Delivered... On Sept 2nd. Go away
4824,Mid,aeternity,I can't tell if you're joking... Lol. So tired of hearing this. ETH is up like 5x since ICO. Some bloodbath ;-)
4825,Mid,aeternity,"Blog post said this would be the case, but it's not clear when they are unlocked. I think soon?"
4826,Mid,aeternity,Awesome. When can they be transferred?

4831,Mid,aeternity,"Wrong answer.The tokens cannot be transfered until tommorrow."
4832,Mid,aeternity,Got them too! You can see them in eitherscan.io if you don't want to use your private key. Just search for your wallet address. That's what the OP was referring to.
4833,Mid,aeternity,I have same problem.

4835,Mid,aeternity,"I received it also using the method above (MEW - add custom token).However I could not send it from one MEW to anothwr MEW, reason : out of gas. Do you know what it means? I have a enough ETH to send it normally."
4836,Mid,aeternity,You'll need some Ethereum (Ether) in your wallet to send.  My wallet (Ethereum Wallet) requires a minimum of 0.05 Ether to send tokens.
4837,Mid,aeternity,What is the circulating supply ? Total supply ? 
4838,Mid,aeternity,Why I can't transfer tokens?
4839,Mid,aeternity,Just got mine also! Awesome!!
4840,Mid,aeternity,It takes time and it depends on the congestion on Ethereum 
4841,Mid,aeternity,"Goto **Contracts**Scroll to the bottom and click **Watch Token**Then enter this address:**0x5ca9a71b1d01849c0a95490cc00559717fcf0d1d**All the fields should come up automatically.You can now go back to your wallet and you'll see your Aeternity showing up there."
4842,Mid,aeternity,"Yani is not a good fit for Ray Kroc. Yani has a software engineering background, and he has been a passionate bitcoin and crypto community member and contributer for years. He worked with Vitalik on the concept of coloured coins before Ethereum existed. He has been the founder of Aeternity since day 1. It's a far stretch to cast him as some ruthless businessman, who barged into the world of crypto and commandeered someone else's business."
4843,Mid,aeternity,Got mine just now too....
4844,Mid,aeternity,"I shared this in the September announcements sticky. Sharing it here again: UPDATE: The deployment of the AE distribution contract on the main Ethereum network is happening in these very moments. This can take a while, once its finished we'll share it. A blog post guiding you on how to access your AE tokens will be published shortly. Tomorrow (Sunday, September 3rd) you will be able to transfer your tokens."
4845,Mid,aeternity,This baby crying of Zack is making the IOU prices drop steadily fast!!! Stop complaining dude. Nobody here can solve your problem.
4846,Mid,aeternity,Your life must be hard.
4847,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, I received mine about 1 hr ago."
4848,Mid,aeternity,Wait until an exchange is announced. Then you open an account on said exchange/s. Go to your wallets on this exchange and search for the aeternity wallet.
4849,Mid,aeternity,"For people that use Myetherwallet, you can make the tokens show up by doing this:Click on ""Add custom token"". Insert the following data:**Adress**: 0x5CA9a71B1d01849C0a95490Cc00559717fCF0D1d**Token Symbol:**AE**Decimals**:18"
4850,Mid,aeternity,"you guys are awesome, it's starting to make sense. One last question, where would i send them to? don't i need a wallet/exchange that supports AE?"
4851,Mid,aeternity,"Yes.  You need to wait until they're ACTUALLY released, not ""fake released"".  The OP is winding you up."
4852,Mid,aeternity,"https://www.myetherwallet.com/#send-transactionThis is where you can enter your private key to access your wallet/send tokens to another adress."
4853,Mid,aeternity,"It's mostly hearsay, we don't have enough information to pick a side; probably the best thing to do would be to invest in both chains."
4854,Mid,aeternity,"I do agree that he could have handled it better, but I would be pretty pissed too if someone were to use my reputation and code to launch a project and then not give me anything for it.That said, blockchains are about decentralization.  And forks do happen for a reason."

4857,Mid,aeternity,"hmm, mine still don't show updo you think they are releasing them in waves? "
4858,Mid,aeternity,"I STRONGLY suggest you get a ledger (or Trezor) wallet and store them on Myetherwallet. With the HW wallet they will be secure ""there"". Still cold storage, you control the keys. Go to their website, they are on back order..."
4859,Mid,aeternity,"no worries i'm holding for the long haul. i'm not selling any of my AE tokens, i just don't know where to put them to know i have them .... hopefully they publish a tutorial or instructions on how to do this for us noobs"
4860,Mid,aeternity,"by the way does anybody knows how i can manage to get the tokens to show up on my etherwallet so i can move them to a different address? thanks a lot in advance!"
4861,Mid,aeternity,"You have to add a custom token. Use https://etherscan.io/token/0x5ca9a71b1d01849c0a95490cc00559717fcf0d1dfor your input data"
4862,Mid,aeternity,i got mine
4863,Mid,aeternity,"I would give it a few days. If OP is being truthful, my bet is they are starting the distribution but checking and being safe as they go. People will list exchanges that it is on. I imagine some of the decentralized exchanges, like Etherdelta and some smaller exchanges like HitBTC might have it.Really, be careful trading all of your coins. This space is a baby and you are not gonna feel good selling too much now should it blow up in the future. Maybe sell a % to cover your cost if she pops.I am not familiar with the Aeternity wallet. Most people used Myetherwallet, Jaxx, etc. I think. It just appears as a token there, or it will. Using your private key though, you should be able to import it into Myetherwallet and then send it where you will. edit- take it back, my coins are there."
4864,Mid,aeternity,Rather a crying baby than a bitter man.
4865,Mid,aeternity,"Where do you see Aeternity there?"
4866,Mid,aeternity,"thanks dudethe wallet was created at the time of ICO contribution and i have the info and i checked but no tokens yet. What confuses me is how can we trade it if we don't even know which exchanges will carry it?Also, where would i input my private key since the wallet was created by Aeternity at time of contribution... it's probably really simple but i can't wrap my head around it"
4867,Mid,aeternity,I got my tokens personally
4868,Mid,aeternity,Are you still looking to buy?
4869,Mid,aeternity,"Once you get them in an address that you control the private key to, you can do what you want. Just like any other token in an address you control. I'm holding.That said, I'm not sure about what OP is saying. Nothing in my account."
4870,Mid,aeternity,Which exchange will it be traded on?
4871,Mid,aeternity,me too
4872,Mid,aeternity,"i haven't received mine yet but what do you do with them once you get them?I'm totally confused as to how we can trade/claim our AE tokens from an ethereum address"
4873,Mid,aeternity,it probably would be better for them to not distribute them today given the bloodbath taking place in the crypto market. i'd rather than release the tokens once its settled down
4874,Mid,aeternity,Cry baby
4875,Mid,aeternity,He is still a genius. Somewhat misunderstood. Very unfortunate though. Bit immature and not a good people person
4876,Mid,aeternity,I got my AE tokens ... contract address 0x5CA9a71B1d01849C0a95490Cc00559717fCF0D1d

4878,Mid,aeternity,"Sir, you're a joke :D"
4879,Mid,aeternity,"If you don't like it, sell.But you're sure as fuck not going to encourage aeternity to give this cunt MY money.He's a cryptoterrorist."
4880,Mid,aeternity,"Lol, of course you can. Code is Code, right now blockchain is looking for that killer app. You dont need a hermit, dressed in a sweatshirt to be the visionary.Bitcoin opened the floodgates, now is a matter of putting together all of what the crypto community has collectively improved upon, make it work, make it user friendly, and market it correctly = recipe for success.Success comes in many forms, a seasoned computer engineer brings lots of technical and managerial experience (something a lone wolf would have no knowledge)If you look at the success of many business and individuals there is always controversy for example Facebook (watch the movie if you dont know) Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison (most infamous for this type of stuff). Did that have any affect on their success??Lets look at the flip side. Lets look an innovator, one of the greatest. What happened to Tesla? Arguably the greatest mind of our time, he died alone and penniless. His ideas were either stolen, or taken due to unfair contracts. Also, after his death many of his ideas were hidden and kept secret as it would fundamentally change the economy. No reliance on coal or gasoline.So it clear that having a great idea or ""vision"" does not equal success. You need a good environment, support from key individuals, and sometimes luck. Zack may be an excellent coder, but the way he acted all this time from beginning to end, was unprofessional. "
4881,Mid,aeternity,"Yep.  I don't see Zack's conversations with Vitalik Buterin anywhere online, unlike Yanislav.Zack was a hired coding hack, nothing more.Yanislav is the genius.  And smart enough to keep out of this sewer too."
4882,Mid,aeternity,"UPDATE: The deployment of the AE distribution contract on the main Ethereum network is happening in these very moments. This can take a while, once its finished we'll share it. A blog post guiding you on how to access your AE tokens will be published shortly. Tomorrow (Sunday, September 3rd) you will be able to transfer your tokens."
4883,Mid,aeternity,"Lol at you for literally buying into Zack's bullshit.Sell up, weak hand boy.  I'll buy!"
4884,Mid,aeternity,"I just wanted to point out that the OP account was made 9 hours ago and has been exclusively used to trash Zach. Sounds like someone who is really invested in making sure aeternity looks good and Zach looks bad. An angry hodler? Someone who works for aeternity? Who knows?"
4885,Mid,aeternity,Worked OK for Ethereal Classic
4886,Mid,aeternity,Quality post yo!
4887,Mid,aeternity,update me pls
4888,Mid,aeternity,"A great day financially, what are you talking about? AE coins haven't been listed on any exchange yet (HitBTC is only an IOU market)."
4889,Mid,aeternity,"I do realize it's my money. I no longer trust ""management"" to handle some of the most basic challenges of running a project like this. They need to be able to do the math and negotiate accordingly. Finding out they ""hired"" some random erlang contractor and labelled him CTO was bad enough. I knew to keep my mouth shut for my investment's sake. But really, speaking out at this point might have a more positive effect then burying our heads in the sand. "
4890,Mid,aeternity,"Bro, they put his picture up on their site and claimed he was their lead developer without having any agreement with him. This was before the ICO. They fucked up."
4891,Mid,aeternity,"So you expect aeternity to set a precedent of negotiating with pricks?Do you not realize this is YOUR money?"
4892,Mid,aeternity,"Hi guys,Got my ETH keys, opened MEW using the private keys, nothing was there, am I supposed to add a custom token and if yes what are the values?"
4893,Mid,aeternity,lmao it sounds like you are the greedy one.
4894,Mid,aeternity,It is our problem isn't it. They could've paid the guy 3 million and saved our 80 million. Instead they beat him up and told him he had no influence or leverage. Ummm do you think they were wrong? I'd say they were wrong.
4895,Mid,aeternity,"Imagine you were running a business and an absolutely critical employee presented you with an ultimatum. Pay me 3 million dollars or I will COST you and investors 80 million. If YOU chose the 80 million dollar loss the loss is on you. Doesn't matter how greedy or wrong you believe Zack is. This could've been mitigated with a very small amount of foresight and humility. A very small amount. ""Management"" is in charge of the purse strings. There were options. They literally CHOSE this option. Fucking morons."
4896,Mid,aeternity,"And after 0:00 a.m. who's the biggest retard? And i say this as a contributor in phase one. ""Management"" couldn't have done a worse job with this mess. ""fire"" the founder and then delay token distribution until the founder of Aeternity drops an atomic bomb on the entire clown show. "
4897,Mid,aeternity,"keep calm ppl the team said they expect to distribute within 2days after testnet 1 or 2 days extra wont hurt, but they can't postponed it > 1 week"

4899,Mid,aeternity,"> All you've proven is your unemployable.Pretty sure the guy wasn't looking for a job. Was Vitalik on Monster looking to be hired to build Ethereum?

4904,Mid,aeternity,"But Aeternity ""managers"" have handled this well?  Aeternity didn't have the experience or expertise to avoid a disaster like this. They couldn't avoid or mitigate a situation like this with someone who clearly has leverage and influence like Zack does? It's one thing to try and convince Zack he has no leverage and another thing to accept it and acknowledge it. They have a bigger problem now and they should take some ownership of it. Blaming and fighting is a pathetic strategy for Aeternity but Zack has nothing to lose. They didn't anticipate this when strong arming him? Demonstrates a lack of experience.. add the hacked funds and the clown show token distribution.. starting to see a pattern? Maybe some other people need to be fired as well? Like the ""owner""."

4920,Mid,aeternity,"It's not uncommon for young people to make bad deals. It happens all the time. Organizations flex and talent comes and goes. Joel appears to be a great hire. And that's all that matters. Look at the early days of Ethereum. There was a lot of individuals who bailed or were asked to bail. A healthy ecosystem of public blockchains with different models is a net positive for cryptocurrency.Ultimately you're betting on decentralization. And historically that has done well for token holders. From Blocknet to Decred to Ethereum to Bitcoin. It's clear the world wants this future to happen. Aeternity has as good a shot as anyone else. "
4921,Mid,aeternity,Heey. Can you shoot me the transaction hash.
4922,Mid,aeternity,"OK, but how does it feel that the lead dev on this project was so naive?"
4923,Mid,aeternity,"I wasn't referring to the tokens or their market price at all.I was making the observation that by trashing his employer to get them to retroactively honor an implicit contract (he posted code on github, AE built an ICO around it, and he demanded a cut), this was an ineffective negotiating tactic.  For most people, what he did would be a career killer."
4924,Mid,aeternity,"When tokens are tradable on a market we see the real effect. Everything else is just speculation. Investors try to avoid too much negative reputation, so blaming Zack now for economical reasons. Zero-Day-Exploits is a real risk and a real leverage he holds. Nobody knows AE as good has him technically."
4925,Mid,aeternity,"Zack posted negative remarks on Reddit about the project, the ICO, his compensation, etc from the inception of the project.  Perhaps he thought this tactic would give him leverage in negotiations with AE leadership, but clearly it didn't.Perhaps he thought AE would be built much like BTC was originally built, in a spirit of voluntarism.  The economics of crypto are so different than 2009, when the number of people who heard of it could fit in one room.  Good ideas, and a lot of bad ideas, are going to be commercialized.  "

4931,Mid,aeternity,Nope. At this time I'm not sure if the tokens are going to be released todya. The AE management can't make enough money by selling theirs because of all the controversy.

4933,Mid,aeternity,Then you don't have to reply. Your destiny was in your own hands all along _ô_„
4934,Mid,aeternity,Why do you assume he has negative negotiation skills? Read his writing again...
4935,Mid,aeternity,"I haven't asked you to agree with me even once. I responded to explain why you are wrong when you say that is immoral to copy and re-use open source software. The terms of open source software licenses are clearly defined, so it's not a matter of opinion, it's verifiable:  https://opensource.org/licenses Whether you find the spirit and terms of open source development moral or not is of no interest to me."

4939,Mid,aeternity,"The whole zero day claim doesn't make any sense in any case applicable. If he finds a zero day in his own code, so can anyone else, and he shouldn't have written code containing a zero day in the first place. Also, the inevitability of 0days kind of makes it even more ridiculous and tops it off.[Edit: grammar + last sentence]"
4940,Mid,aeternity,"The timing is also suspicious: on the day the tokens get released. This means it is a concerted effort to do as much damage as possible, which gives him less credibility. He should have come clean earlier, then I would have believed him."

4943,Mid,aeternity,Sounds great! Look forward to hearing what comes out of AE Labs.
4944,Mid,aeternity,"This is probably the best approach. This is also reddit. For all you know, people here supporting Zack are those wanting to buy in for cheap and those support management are those who secretly want to dump.I'm all for openness and debate but the value of discussing this topic without more information is pretty low.  If you want to believe that the management are unscrupulous scammers, you'll focus on evidence of that, whether it's true or not.What is true is that rumors like this tend to take on a life of their own and can have effects that are felt for years. So, it's probably a good idea to just let this play out and not interject lots of speculation from the outside. "
4945,Mid,aeternity,"Zack hasn't claimed that Aeternity is stealing his code, where did you get that accusation from? Zack said that he suspects they will continue to use his code, and the Aeternity team deny this. Zack never accused anyone of theft. There's no basis for that as it's all open source software.Zack also never used the word attack. He said the owner of Aeternity 'did something to him'. Another vague insinuation from Zack that leaves the circumstances up to the readers imagination. If he believes he was assaulted he should say so, but I don't think he will, because the facts may not align with the abstract picture he would like to paint for you."
4946,Mid,aeternity,Lol im one of the bigger investors and im so disappointed. If only the volume of trading now is better i'm out. I fully support zach in this.
4947,Mid,aeternity,"To be fair, zack has no evidence either."
4948,Mid,aeternity,"I agree on the conclusion, but see a need to really not give too much importance to this here..Why? Because, I seriously think you take HitBTC prices WAY to seriously. I've been trading there for literal months and the price, as I have described elsewhere in this sub, always fluctuates between 0.0001-0.00035. Its totally normal behavior, and the recent pump and dump is just what it always does.Not only that, HitBTC prices are empirically actually not really something to go by. Why? Because its not a real market. Its simply no indication. It is pegged (only) to BTC and does not react independently of this. Example: When BTC goes up, AE just stays the same in relation to BTC, actually also going up, since its only pegged to BTC. Considering the bad communication strategy of AE before the new CTO and no good news during that time, in a real market the relative price of AE/BTC should have went down, instead. Yet, the price actually tripled, because of BTC going up that much. So it doesnt really behave as a crypto in its own right on HitBTC. Similarly, the EOS IOU showed that HitBTC was actually a week late in connection the (fake market) IOU to the mainnet, which therefore had completely disconnected prices compared to actual trading on bitfinex and kraken. So, yeah. Keep cool, it it will go through the roof with time ;-)"
4949,Mid,aeternity,"Stealing code to make money and give the dev a tip for it and call him ""junior dev"". He even stated that he was physically attacked. I guess there is no proof for this, so the outstanding observer will never really know. If there is, he should call the police immedeatly and hire a lawyer. I see this as an AE fork that happend, Zack will continue with his development. Maybe he lauches his own ICO. Hopefully he wilil.""The Aeternity lawyer spent 5 days with me, begging me to sign the contract. I wonder how much lawyers get paid per hour. He kept saying stuff like ""This contract is only for you Zack, it doesn't benefit us at all."""" What are this for crazy methods?"
4950,Mid,aeternity,That's a logical fallacy. In many cases of extortion or libel the victims do not engage our sue because the process can be more costly and damaging than the claim. This is particularly true with fabricated stories about celebrities in tabloid media for example.
4951,Mid,aeternity,"Yeah, pretty much, has that written all over it. Now, maybe there is some truth to it all, fair enough, but such is running a company. I get a feeling that some of these ICO's are very big business, and very big threats to other existing cryptos/tech. I noticed InsureX (the one that had half their ICO wallet hacked) has been getting hammered on reddit too, but their price is really up. Well, I expect the same with Aeternity, perhaps it will create some noise..."
4952,Mid,aeternity,Without him you could not have invested at all. Very understable human reaction from him. Bad managment form the AE owner. 
4953,Mid,aeternity,I actually deleted all my comments and went private message. There is too much anger in all this and we should cool down (at least that's what I do)
4954,Mid,aeternity,"> won't pick up on details of his lets say very immaturely written statement.Please provide information and evidence from your side instead of just calling him immature."
4955,Mid,aeternity,"If you have a 'moral' issue with the terms of open source software development, then you shouldn't develop open source software. There are many other licencing models that are not established around the spirit of free and open sharing and re-use of code, and include protections concerning the intellectual property, sharing and use of code. Zack however, is an open source software developer. He embraces that sprit of free and open sharing of code."
4956,Mid,aeternity,"It's too early to reach a conclusion. I expect that there is going to be some behind-the-scenes communication going on before any more thorough statements are being made - that's how professionals would be advised to handle a matter such as this, anyway."
4957,Mid,aeternity,"I guess this discussion will not go anywhere. I wrote: ""Its morally wrong, even if it is legal."" We have different opinons on that and this is okay. We do not need to agree."
4958,Mid,aeternity,"Of course he's allowed to say whatever he wants, and we're all free to respond and comment on that too You're welcome. If at any point you discover evidence that I'm wrong, and there is actually limits on how much open source code can be shared and re-used, please publish that information so everyone can see it."
4959,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed 100%.This petty incident has wiped a good 25% off the value of aeternity if hitBTC prices are anything to go by, plus inflicted damage to the aeternity project.  Shows what a selfish, childish prick Zack is, and sadly shows that if he exhibited this attitude at work, he was probably the worst employee ever who aeternity had been trying to get rid of for months.I imagine Zack has shot his load now, and anything further from him will have no effect.  This should be in the past, regardless of silly threats to uncover zero day issues.Time to move on.  Let him take his ball and go home.  If he was as good as he says he is, aeternity would be begging to keep him.I expect he was one massive part of the problems aeternity has had over the past few months.  He sounds uncontrollable, unreliable, and someone who never gave a fuck about anyone but himself.Thank god Joel cleared him out and got serious with the project."
4960,Mid,aeternity,"I think Aeternity have actually made the best of the opportunities that have resulted from this situation. They have a new CTO who is very experienced, professional and open and they have taken swift and decisive correct action by continuing development of the project without Zacks code."
4961,Mid,aeternity,"I just answer: Zack is allowed to say whatever he wants. We have free speech. So nothing to see here, everything is fine and just move on?But anyways thanks for telling me that I do not understand and you are the owner of the truth."
4962,Mid,aeternity,"Ethereum uses concepts and ideas from bitcoin, but builds on them and develops them in a new direction. That is the spirit of open source code and that is exactly what Aeternity is doing.'You can use pieces here and there of free software'No, you don't understand open source. There is no limit to how much open source code you can use. It's all free to share and re-use for whatever purpose you like. That is the spirit of open source software. There is a flip-side to this as it applies to Aeternity and Zack: Aeternity have no intellectual property rights to the software Zack developed whilst employed by them either. He too, can re-use the code for whatever purpose he sees fit."
4963,Mid,aeternity,"There are ways to deal with this like a grown-up, rather than trashing the investments of thousands of small investors like you and me.He has shown zero concern for us all.  I despise being used as a pawn in someone else's fight.  He's just taken money out of my pocket, basically.What an asshole."
4964,Mid,aeternity,"When millions come, greed kicks in. Pretty standard nowadays."
4965,Mid,aeternity,"Not a chance!  Zack's ""AngryBoy"" blockchain, led by the crypto equivalent of Kim Jung Un?"
4966,Mid,aeternity,"I also hold AE tokens, but just take this comment that gets it quite good: ""If I had worked on a project since 2015, and then someone wanted to use it to launch an ICO, label me as a junior dev, use the product that I refined over the years, and not even include me as a founder - I would be pretty jilted too.""Dont blame only Zack, also blame the owner of Aeternity for this. I also hold AE tokens, but just continuig as there was nothing will not make it better. The paths that this discussion has begun and that reputation is damaged (for now, you might can rebuilt it), this is now part of the project. Crises create also opportunites."
4967,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed.  Hold firm on this investment.Classic disgruntled employee attitude: wait until a key moment, throw out unverified claims, threats, and smash up the place like an angry teenage girl who didn't get a pony for her 14th.Sad.  Can't wait for the official aeternity response - and while aeternity staying silent was classy and the professional road to take, Zack has certainly opened the door for a detailed reply to set the record straight.  If he hasn't already destroyed his career, aeternity's counter will."
4968,Mid,aeternity,Messy indeed. Everyone's waiting to dump i suppose and wait for his project.
4969,Mid,aeternity,"The spirit of open source code is not meant to be to leave the developer with nothing and to enrich the people who see the opportunity to make lots of money with the code. You can use pieces here and there of free software, but just taking the whole thing in this context is morally wrong.       they are not using Zack's codeThey still use his concepts and ideas, even if they rewrite and restructure the code."
4970,Mid,aeternity,"Personally, I don't trust this guy. Guy who gets fired then comes forward with more BS? Sounds like a relative of Comey."
4971,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed, and something is a bit weird here. The price has been doing very well but the hate continues. I'm wondering how much of his is indeed nefarious. I see it also with InsureX, which had money stolen from the ICO wallet, but they also are doing very well regarding the price."
4972,Mid,aeternity,"I don't think everything Zack wrote is true either. It's clear that he has an agenda to damage Aeternity and he will say anything if he thinks it will harm the project. I'm not sure what you mean about it being wrong to freely re-use open source code. The whole point of open source is that anyone is free to re-use it as they see fit. But in the case of Aeternity, they are not using Zack's code."
4973,Mid,aeternity,"I do not concede everything what Zack wrote as true. As I wrote, he is definitly not fabricating the story based on nothing. Even if Zack made too big demands on the project, the owner of Aeternity just should have set up a agreement first and than lauch the project and collect money. You just cannot take the ideas and concepts from somebody and than leave him out with such an attitude. I dont know the licences Zack used for his code, but it is just wrong to use open source free code in such a manner. Its morally wrong, even if it is legal."
4974,Mid,aeternity,"If I had worked on a project since 2015, and then someone wanted to use it to launch an ICO, label me as a junior dev, use the product that I refined over the years, and not even include me as a founder - I would be pretty jilted too.If someone had of said to me at ICO time - ""so we're going to start the codebase over from scratch with a bunch of great Erlang devs, but none who have really spent any time in blockchain"". I would 100% of not invested. Marketing is great, but it gets people in the door - it's the substance that keeps them. Regardless of any of the teams personality quirks, it was the strength of the testnet and Zack's contributions that got me to invest. There are lots of ICOs with great marketing and colorful landing pages, but it's the killer demo that does it.I get that you have to make the best of things, so that's what the team is doing right now, but downplaying Zack's role in the success of Aeternity to this point is unfair.I'm sure there are two sides to the story - it sounds like Zack is still hurting from whatever went down; but at the same time Aeternity's new CTO (who is great at comms) is representing his company that just raised 77 million dollars or so. So of course they have the incentive to say ""of course everything is fine"". Joel may say that they are not using any of his code their, but I'm pretty sure in the telegram someone was just saying in the last 24 hours or so that they will pull in code from the other version when required?Oh, and on the anonymous thing - Janislav (Yani) is not anonymous at all - https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5 . Unless there is someone else with the same name (except first name is spelled with a J) who is behind Aeternity. Neither are the other two people on the list either? They both have public profiles and posts linking them to Aeternity. Anyway, sad situation. Best of luck to both projects.Will definitely be watching for Zack's one."
4975,Mid,aeternity,"Okay, let me put this even more simple: Zack is not different from a random coder on the street. He claims he will publish zero days because it is his code, it isn't though. He ofc can find them, but not because he wrote the code."
4976,Mid,aeternity,Why should Zack not be able to find zero days in the new code?
4977,Mid,aeternity,"You sound alarmingly certain for some random guy on the internet who has never even met any of the people in question in real life.This must be how cults are born. Convince stupid people with your rhetoric and hope they follow you blindly."
4978,Mid,aeternity,"For people that are not in the slack:Hello everyone! Cross-posting my telegram comment in here ""I'm here like basically always. Although I'm became more quiet in the chats, because of lots of ""offline work"", I'm watching and reading most of the conversations ;) Zacks writing contains very irritating statements I must say. Due to the fact that I know him on a personal basis quite well, I won't pick up on details of his lets say very immaturely written statement. I wish him well an hope he has some learnings out of this. A team and a project of such scope is not a one-man-show. Therefore I'm happy to see how Joel, our CTO steps up, takes up responsibility, integrates in the existing team and also is open and approachable for the community!""- Marion"
4979,Mid,aeternity,"Sorry guys, for ethical reasons I stop supporting Aeternity (Edit: If the staus quo does not change)! I do not want to be part of this project anymore (Edit: for now). Zack is definitly not fabricating this story based on nothing. I feel really sad for the project. Zack should have been the boss and not the marketing guy with dollar or whatever signs in his eyes. He is a rude character and I dont think this project can grow under his role...I do not saw anything coming from the owner of Aeternity, he did not speak with the community at all. Zack did and was the inventor of the whole projejct. The owner just ""steal"" his code to enrich himself. Zack, I support you. You are right, he is wrong.2. Edit: ""Marion also has not been paid"" I communicated with her, she sees to be quite nice, so good to hear she is not part of this."
4980,Mid,aeternity,"The kind of guy who writes this stuff and explicitly threatens to destroy the project is hardly someone trustworthy or of good character.  Take what you read with a massive pinch of salt.We've heard one side of the story, and it's from a self-confessed malicious person.  Selling zero-day stuff?  Yeah, an all round nice guy...And career suicide too.  No legit project will hire this kind of person, no matter how brilliant."
4981,Mid,aeternity,"You want over 3 million dollars? Do you believe you earned that? You don't need to answer that, I know the answer."
4982,Mid,aeternity,"In the context where Joel wrote it, you clearly understood that he meant ""Zack cannot do what he says he will do"" - which are zero days."
4983,Mid,aeternity,"> There are no zero days.This statement is unprofessional. There are always zero days in every piece of code. Also in the new one."
4984,Mid,aeternity,"I have read everything about this whole thing and came to the conclusion that this is probably just a case of young coder who thinks the world belongs to him. Maybe he thought he was more important than he really was, maybe he thought he was the key player in this project. Who knows what really happened.Do not believe everything this guy says. There is always two sides to a story. Also:> There are no zero days. And we are not using any of Zackäó»s code in the new repo. Take a look at our Github.> Zackäó»s leaving has zero effect on our technology and **we are not using any of his code.** - Joel, CTO of AeternityKeep this in mind. Apparently Zacks work isn't even used anymore. I don't want to call him delusional, but his statements definitely strike me as odd."
4985,Mid,aeternity,"Regarding the ""free"" Tokens on Mainnet launch: Will there be some sort of Airdrop, is this what you are referring to? I wasn't aware there was going to be one."
4986,Mid,aeternity,"Aeternity is refusing to pay me for the work that I have already done.I am not willing to do any more work for them, bounty or otherwise, until they pay for what I already did."
4987,Mid,aeternity,"I am willing to make Aeternity secure for about 10% of how much money they have now, which is the same as 5% of how much they had before the hack.This seems more than reasonable to me.Aeternity is only willing to pay me about 1%."
4988,Mid,aeternity,"Well, if he truly is the creator of the project and the only developer, how much you think he should get and how much do you thing he actually got? "
4989,Mid,aeternity,Its actually not a crime to sell zero days... using them is different. There are companies that find the zero days and sell them eg endgame. 
4990,Mid,aeternity,"I agree. The more of Zacks posts I read, the more I realize that he is very immature and bitter because his demands for 50% of all ICO funds weren't met. He seems like a control freak, and I think he's done his reputation a lot of damage."

5001,Mid,aeternity,TL;DR
5002,Mid,aeternity,"Good to see progress! I downloaded the CSV from your link and searched for my contribution address. However, my ETH address isn't listed. I contributed ETH and received a ledger. Can you advise so I can be sure I'll receive my AE please?Edit: Nevermind. I found my address under the Token Holders link: https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0x8667559254241ddeD4d11392f868d72092765367#balances"
5003,Mid,aeternity,"Hey, for a Slack invite, please send a mail to info@aeternity.com. You will be able to claim the Ledger very soon, the wallet.aeternity.com website will go live very soon. New claiming deadline will be announced."
5004,Mid,aeternity,"sweetbreh [-8]There's a reason why I have downvoted you 8 times in the past already."
5005,Mid,aeternity,Lolyourname
5006,Mid,aeternity,I think as the weeks go on until main net launch I'll be buying small amounts per week. Depending on prices of course
5007,Mid,aeternity,99% is good news!
5008,Mid,aeternity,Thanks for the update! That is some good news
5009,Mid,aeternity,Selling some holding most
5010,Mid,aeternity,"I'm interested to see what happens to that price. Is it inflated because of the relative scarcity before token issue? Or is it suppressed because of the time since the ICO phases and token issue?It'll be an interesting ride in either case."
5011,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed. With a few notable exceptions, one of the biggest hurdles that a lot of ICO project put in from of themselves is only listing their tokens on 1 or maybe 2 exchanges with little to no volume.  When I see someone list only on Cryptopia or Tidex, I get out.  EtherDelta is the exception.  It's okay as an initial or supplemental exchange to be listed on, but it's the rare token that can survive and thrive while only being listed on ED."
5012,Mid,aeternity,Thank you
5013,Mid,aeternity,"Let me update you:We have found and fixed a few bugs related to the distribution smart contract and we are now 99% ready to deploy it on the Kovan testnet. Once the latest deployment is approved, it will be shared with you in all channels.The BTC tool is also 99% ready and will be announced soon as well.More or less, I believe that the test net deployment is 99% ready and we will announce it in a few hours. It will represent 99% of all AE tokens. The final 1% will be added during mainnet launch and it represents the ""free"" AE tokes for BTC/ETH holders.We will also publish the guide on how to access your tokens. I will make sure it is spread all around in our channels.That's all for now."
5014,Mid,aeternity,"I assume there will be a bunch of pre-mined coins, equal to or greater than the tokens being distributed. They'll probably ask for some sort of proof that you own the ETH addresses ~~with using which you donated~~ which have AE tokens and then transfer the correct amount of coins from that bunch to your AE address on the main net."
5015,Mid,aeternity,"Lol, my mechanical brain failed to make that out of it"
5016,Mid,aeternity,I meant that you stay on the ground and dont dream your dreams...
5017,Mid,aeternity,"Thinking about dumping another 5k into this tonight, via hitBTC.  God only knows where the prices might end up (and probably not even him), and wanna lock in while it's still closer to $1 than $10."
5018,Mid,aeternity,Where is the team i need an answer
5019,Mid,aeternity,"Well it is none of your biz but someone stole all my ether while using their site. We should not have to use it and put all our eggs in one basket. It is a ""bottle neck"" and their site has had glitches. I trust aeternity more. Yani knows how to make a killer wallet securely styly"
5020,Mid,aeternity,"Dear redditor for 0 hours, there's just so much that you're wrong about in your post.  I can post a detailed reason why but I don't think you care.  If I happen to be wrong about whether you care, respond below and I'll provide some explanation."
5021,Mid,aeternity,HODL.... I still have my original crowd fund ETH wallet.  From a psychological position.... i don't think I'm capable of selling any cryptos.... 
5022,Mid,aeternity,Nope!
5023,Mid,aeternity,"The current expected date for token release is September 2nd, though it isn't guaranteed."
5024,Mid,aeternity,Lambos ahoy!
5025,Mid,aeternity,"There is no air on the moon, spoilers dont work. Besides looking cool they don't have a function.Edit: Okay okay, a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge spoiler would catch enough space dust to maybe generate a bit of downforce. Too lazy to calculate now, its friday."
5026,Mid,aeternity,Not touching them until the platform goes live.
5027,Mid,aeternity,We are no longer focusing on betting and prediction markets.
5028,Mid,aeternity,"If by supporting emerging countries you mean those with very low-power hardware and bandwidth then no. Not in the first version anyway. Also, our current software platform (Erlang) does not run on the smartphone."
5029,Mid,aeternity,"Just hodl. Wait for the development of the mainnet.Personally Im going to wait a few weeks and buy more every month. First weeks usually the price goes up and then dips to the ico price (and sometimes lower). Then buy. I dont know if Aeternity will be a success or not but they are going to deliver a proper chain. I've been stalking the developers and they are really good doing what they do. I think their are able to deliver Zack's vision even better than Zack himself. "
5030,Mid,aeternity,I'm gonna buy a lambo limousine.  Full of champagne.
5031,Mid,aeternity,Why don't you trust MEW? 
5032,Mid,aeternity,Any word on what time this might happen tomorrow?  (Later is better so I don't have to wake up early!)
5033,Mid,aeternity,"A nice move.  Much as I'd love to see a bunch of whiny sellers here so I can pick up some cheap aeternity, I think tomorrow will see prices holding steady at around $1.50.If it dips, I'll buy more.  Actually, who am I kidding?  This is still very early days for aeternity, so I'll be buying in more no matter what."
5034,Mid,aeternity,Did not get into pre-sale/ico so I will be buying
5035,Mid,aeternity,Holding.
5036,Mid,aeternity,You're too emotional.
5037,Mid,aeternity,"I'll be holding and buying more as it drops, which hopefully will be due to the impatient guys panicking and posting 'sky is falling' messages here. I haven't done any quick profit investments yet (although there's nothing wrong with that since some friends made crazy money doing that). But this is a field that has the potential to make major disruptions. Either you day trade or you go all in. Hopefully my all in turns out to be like Amazon and not Netscape haha. "
5038,Mid,aeternity,I do not trust my ether wallet. Can we use the ae wallet on aeternity.com?
5039,Mid,aeternity,"I assume Kraken or Polo, because i have high expectations after all these months of hard work @aeternity. I think they will do this properly and have some big exchange news tomorrow."
5040,Mid,aeternity,"Of course holding! Come on, we have a new CTO and development seems really to get going now.Price on Hitbtc increased by 27% today. 1,5 $ now."
5041,Mid,aeternity,Holding. But interested what exchanges will adopt this coin. I hope for a few big ones. They had time enough to arrange this :-)
5042,Mid,aeternity,"What role will play predicitive markets now in aeternity?governance still on PM's?How will be the oracles decentralized? I read that priority is in oracles but betting is let apart for the moment.Thanks!"
5043,Mid,aeternity,Yes.
5044,Mid,aeternity,"Hi Joel!!wellcome onboard and thanks a lot for your fresh and direct style,I really like it and think it was a needed asset!! I post hereby three simple questions,but important for the development of my project Shelpin on top of aeternity and other stuff I am moving with aeternity. I post here the first one and the other two in two separate comments!thanks!!Will the platform still be designed to include (that is mining,developing,researching) emerging countries in this Party...?I.e smartphone mining,low bandwidht need...?"
5045,Mid,aeternity,"While I agree with you. Dont forget Aeternity also had an ICO.....Im invested in Aeternity so im looking forward to their success, however I also believe ethereum is involved in some very good things and is pushing crypto upwards."
5046,Mid,aeternity,HODLING!!!!!
5047,Mid,aeternity,We are not focusing on markets for financial derivatives but expect people to build them on top of AE. 
5048,Mid,aeternity,C-
5049,Mid,aeternity,"This is a blatant pump, and FUD. The Ethereum team is trying to do the very thing you write about. Tezos, and Aeternity are both potentially good hedges though."
5050,Mid,aeternity,ok
5051,Mid,aeternity,whoo that is a long read. can you post a summary in 3 sentences?
5052,Mid,aeternity, a huuuge spoiler is necessary
5053,Mid,aeternity,"What do you think about title graphics on ae_cto twitter https://twitter.com/ae_cto vs other graphics (  title graphics https://twitter.com/aetrnty, aeternity.com)? I think it will be great to incorporate ae_cto title theme through entire project. It's clean and comunicate grown-upness. To give some credit to @aetrnity twitter graphics, grey logo is doing the same. Maybe even more than pink ;) "
5054,Mid,aeternity,"Hi Joel,one of use cases were markets for financial derivatives. As you are not focusing on them, do you expect them beeing created by people who wants to make aepps on top of AE? Are they still one of major use cases? Or, what will be the major use case/cases in your opinion? Maybe your personal motivation for building AE. Thanks"
5055,Mid,aeternity,"Lunch of the mainnet?  I guess my invitation and menu choices were list in the mail.I'll have the shrimp to start, the beef as a main, and the creme brule for dessert.  Starts at 12, right, at the country club?"
5056,Mid,aeternity,Id love bittrex to
5057,Mid,aeternity,Exciting stuff. Im sure you guys are too!
5058,Mid,aeternity,Thanks for the quick reply! 
5059,Mid,aeternity,You will be able to access them at MyEtherWallet. For BTC contributors - will first need to generate an ETH public/private key pair from your BTC public/private key (or seed) pair using a tool we will provide. It not hard at all and we will provide a guide.
5060,Mid,aeternity,I expect liqui to list it. Maybe bittrex
5061,Mid,aeternity,It's mooning there.  An omen for Saturday?
5062,Mid,aeternity,"I don't get it. The site mentioned April and May, the FAQ post mentions August, and posts now mention September. Do people already have this token or has it yet to be distributed? "
5063,Mid,aeternity,That would be awesome and to be hoped for... we will see.
5064,Mid,aeternity,"If we assume a valuation similar to other similar projects ($200-400m market cap), everyone will be quite happy and the token price will be ~ $1.50Chill out, guys."
5065,Mid,aeternity,"Hitbtc is probably a likely candidate, seeing as they are trading the IOU already."
5066,Mid,aeternity,"Hey, if you cannot access the tokens on the testnet, you will not be able to get them once they are distributed as ERC20 tokens."
5067,Mid,aeternity,"Yes.  You need special ""extra gravity""  tires else you will drive off the moon. "
5068,Mid,aeternity,"That's a sweet color, breh. Mine will be iridescent colored so when I am launched from the moon into another galaxy of wealth the peasants on Earth shall see me as a shooting star."
5069,Mid,aeternity,Red Lambo!!!
5070,Mid,aeternity,I contributed by BTC.
5071,Mid,aeternity,i want to enter the slack too. can u invite me? my email is roumo2011@gmail.com.
5072,Mid,aeternity,Might want to fix the date in your comment. You know how literal some people take comments these days.
5073,Mid,aeternity,"Mining will start at the release of the aeternity blockchain in Q1 2018.The tokens being distributed now are interim ones that you will be able to exchange form main net tokens later on the release."
5074,Mid,aeternity,There are already several devs on the project. Check the website and Github.
5075,Mid,aeternity,"Hi Vlad, any instructions how to do this now that the tokens are about to be distributed? Checking with the original eth address (the one I lost the key for) on the Kovan (test) network I can see the tokens sent to it. Using the aeternity seed on myetherwallet I get a different address --as expected-- which has not received tokens. Is it possible to send the tokens on the mainnet to the address I get when using the aeternity seed? Thank you in advance."
5076,Mid,aeternity,Updated: 31/08/2017
5077,Mid,aeternity,Good work Joel! Best of luck with the interviewing. 
5078,Mid,aeternity,No
5079,Mid,aeternity,"IF you contributed to the ICO by BTC, I received this info.http://i.imgur.com/29zbyEO.png"
5080,Mid,aeternity,"Site is back up, but when you click on wallet, it just spins. I also would like to check and confirm my balance. I contributed BTC from Blockchain.info for the ICO.Address is https://wallet.aeternity.com/. You misspelled it above."
5081,Mid,aeternity,Cheers
5082,Mid,aeternity,Good job!
5083,Mid,aeternity,"Is it possible to mine Tokens on the Sept. 2nd, as it is the lunch of the mainnet?"
5084,Mid,aeternity,haha :D
5085,Mid,aeternity,We did it y'all
5086,Mid,aeternity,Have a look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeternity/comments/6x1k16/token_launch_expected_on_saturday_sept_2/) (and the link it refers to).
5087,Mid,aeternity,"I can confirm, Joel is great :)"
5088,Mid,aeternity,"Joel is in charge of the blockchain dev together with Yanislav and the rest of the devs. Once we get the AE token out, there will be nothing to worry about :)"
5089,Mid,aeternity,"It is not that. We will make the test contact live tomorrow. For now, you can use this [test implementation](https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0xC85Ec29adc32D8edB452C8D85Ad488Cb1337cCF7), which does not include the tokens for the aeternity foundation and bounties. It contains all contributors and the amount of AE tokens they will receive."
5090,Mid,aeternity,"Ditto, great news to hear"
5091,Mid,aeternity,"Woo hoo!Loving the new CTO and how he's sorting this project out.  Worth his weight in gold.Looking forward to picking up another sackful of aeternity tokens from disgruntled investors who want out.  Definitely a hodler!"
5092,Mid,aeternity,"yeah but it is for the eternity #punintended"
5093,Mid,aeternity,Great! Thank you for the update! 
5094,Mid,aeternity,Where can I look at the code involved? I could find https://github.com/aeternity/contraect but I'm not sure since that repository hasn't been updated for 2 months.
5095,Mid,aeternity,August 33rd!
5096,Mid,aeternity,"Just read the notes from today.  https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/wiki/Meeting-notes-30082017All I want to say is -- thank you and <3 <3 <3 Edit:  I don't know if the change in detail/tone is based on community feedback but it's night and day better from ""Do it better and faster than before"" from 8/24.  "
5097,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, today is August 30th......Keep in mind Joel is now the new CTO, you cant hold him accountable for the promises and mistakes made before his arrival. I am confident in his ability to turn this project into the shining beacon we wall invested into."
5098,Mid,aeternity,Thank you!
5099,Mid,aeternity,Fake post
5100,Mid,aeternity,YAS!!!! It's Moon time
5101,Mid,aeternity,Okay? 
5102,Mid,aeternity,Fake news.
5103,Mid,aeternity,"2pm UTC happens when this comment is 20 hours and 5 minutes old.You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/fhE44881X---I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM."
5104,Mid,aeternity,"Clap Clap, Finally, transparency. Keep this up Joel"
5105,Mid,aeternity,Good bot
5106,Mid,aeternity,"We're not receiving what we're owed, which is a professionally-developed and managed blockchain.  The token delays are a mere symptom of far greater underlying project: chronic apathy from the development team (excluding Joel)."
5107,Mid,aeternity,Looking to get some AE when it hits exchanges
5108,Mid,aeternity,"You cant, unless you sell a promise to give the tokens, In that case you would need to arrange some type of escrow or really trust that person."
5109,Mid,aeternity,"Totally, crypto is not a ""if you build it, they will come"" type of space. You need to actively promote yourself.I myself wouldn't mind posting in other sub reddits about aeternity, however they have given me nothing to write home about."
5110,Mid,aeternity,"No one has gotten them yet. Just stating our expectations were to get them ""soon after"" the ICO, but that was never met"
5111,Mid,aeternity,I found private key!! thx :)
5112,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed, looking forward to it"
5113,Mid,aeternity,I think he means that some members of the community are upset that tokens have not been distributed at all.
5114,Mid,aeternity,">I understand a lot of community members are upset they did not get their tokens as quickly as expected ( myself included).Wait, there are people who have got them? How?"
5115,Mid,aeternity,After the tokens get launched it would be really cool if Yanislav would do some more promo videos similar to how Vitalik promotes ethereum. Doesn't seem to be much informational videos out which could really help bring awareness.
5116,Mid,aeternity,"I imagine their devs are doing unit and integration testing as thats what devs do.I would think that goes straight to UAT which is public in this case on testnet.The development for mainnet is underway, they arent blowing the entire budget in a few months like you seem to want them to. Id say use as little costing as possible as it has to last them a decade most likely. And half of it has gone.Throwing money at something doesnt make it good. You need to understand the time - cost - quality triangle is just that.How much money dobyou expect them to spend on ecr20 tokens nothing to do with the actual project?"
5117,Mid,aeternity,"Sure, QA takes time.  But in ae's case, it's been a slow process because of sheer incompetence.  For months, they've had the money to deliver on this, but have instead sat there doing nothing.A large portion of the ICO funding was earmarked for development costs (including QA), yet very little has been spent.  The frustration comes from seeing ae lounge around on an overstuffed couch filled with our dollars, essentially ignoring every single promise made before we invested.Who is doing the QA at aeternity?  Has anyone been hired, or is this on Yanislav's to-do list like I suspect 99% of all the development tasks are?Question: is there a problem with delegation at aeternity?  Because someone there needs to start letting others help."
5118,Mid,aeternity,"Have you ever done QA?Its not straight cutMaybe pm wasnt great at first but heres a clear improvement.Source: am a QA analyst"
5119,Mid,aeternity,"Hey, these are the concepts that the design team is working on. I think there is more info here: https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-prototypes"
5120,Mid,aeternity,"Thanks, was testing that."
5121,Mid,aeternity,The team is really doing as much as possible to meet the promise of distribution by the end of August. We don't want anyone begging. Everyone who contributed will receive what he is owned 100%. Some people are just really very impatient.
5122,Mid,aeternity,Tomorrow is the last day in August. Is there a last minute mail on how to take the AE tokens distributed?
5123,Mid,aeternity,"Thank you, https://hitbtc.com/exchange/AE-to-BTC and https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeternity/ are the same IOU trading"
5124,Mid,aeternity,Agreed. Yani should do an AMA!
5125,Mid,aeternity,/u/vdramaliev
5126,Mid,aeternity,Duly noted.
5127,Mid,aeternity,"Good on you Vlad, keep things heading in the right direction."
5128,Mid,aeternity,"Completely agree. It's an exciting project.I'm with you on the fact Yani needs to be as visible and as transparent as Joel currently is. "
5129,Mid,aeternity,"There's nothing to worry about. This is just how thing's work, if you hold, you will make a gain once main net is launched and as the technology is adopted. Possibly a huge gain in comparison to the ICO prices in phase 2.  I bought in during Phase 2, cheap. I didn't buy ETH on the day of the ICO, so the price of ETH during Phase 2 doesn't apply to me. The above logic doesn't really work for me. You have to take that into consideration. For me it's the price I paid for the ETH, not the price of ETH on the day I bought in to the ICO. If Ae goes up, great, but I won't sell. If Ae goes down, great.. I will definitely buy more as others panic and I will honestly hope it goes down further! Why? Because I was always holding until the project is developed and launched. That's were the value is. Warren Buffett said it best ""Be fearful when other's are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful""."
5130,Mid,aeternity,But why the false promises? Why the lies? Why make people who invested in the project beg?
5131,Mid,aeternity,I just read the blog post about the proof of aexistence aepp.. but where can I actually download it? 
5132,Mid,aeternity,that's great to hear. I'll buy more when everyone panics and it drops like a stone. 
5133,Mid,aeternity,Correction: /u/ae-cto
5134,Mid,aeternity,"I'm not trying to be difficult or complain about the lack of token distribution, the list of items discussed seem like generic development principles that a non-technical project manager would spout on a moment's notice.  They're fluffy guidelines to aspire to and doesn't give any visibility, technical or otherwise, on the actual project.Again, not trying to be difficult.  "
5135,Mid,aeternity,"Price is now roughly .99You probably should have just bought them from hitBTC."
5136,Mid,aeternity,Nobody cares. When is token distribution? Looks like you lied again about token release date.
5137,Mid,aeternity,"yeah sure the holy ""2 weeks"" "
5138,Mid,aeternity,"Not sure but perhaps bc a lot of bids here seem to be coming in at $0.45 and $0.50. Meanwhile IOU trading is over $1: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeternity/."
5139,Mid,aeternity,Thanks for your quick reply. That's clear then. Satisfied to hear the blockchain development is on track. 
5140,Mid,aeternity,The notes have nothing to do with the token release process. These are notes about our blockchain development. I'll try to make sure this is clear. I will also reword the keeping it simple note.
5141,Mid,aeternity,They are not meant to be technical. These are summaries of what's going on. You can look at our project board and issues if you want to get more technical.
5142,Mid,aeternity,/u/ae_cto 
5143,Mid,aeternity,"Although these points are informally written, I am happy we are kept up to date. Especially item 3: No over-engineering. We are short on time so we want to do things right but not strive to make them perfect. This is written down a bit unstrategically written down. I do understand what you mean, but it may raise some questions to some I think. I do not want to be rude on Point 1, but regarding the token release this is nonsense, that is much later than was planned. Other internal progression I cannot judge about, maybe that is what is meant in point 1. "
5144,Mid,aeternity,"We went through a lot in the past few months, but we are getting back on track. Getting there."
5145,Mid,aeternity,"_These meeting notes are__Not very technical....... That's__A bit worrisome._&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^- ^gimperion------------------------------^^I'm ^^a ^^bot ^^made ^^by ^^/u/Eight1911. ^^I ^^detect ^^haiku."
5146,Mid,aeternity,These meeting notes are not very technical....... That's a bit worrisome. 
5147,Mid,aeternity,"Sure, but you've had the money to hire experienced employees to structure and roll this out for months now.  The time for ""serious amounts of testing"" was July.Any chance you all can stop reinventing the wheel and instead hire staff who know how to do this stuff?"
5148,Mid,aeternity,...but requires serious amount of testing. :) Working on it.
5149,Mid,aeternity,"Excuse me, calculation based on ICO Phases limits (800 - 750 - 700 Ae/ETH for Phase II etc.) includes bias. Here could be used different evaluation models, for example, present value or future value of assets  (and the theft of ETH and expenses make matter for cash flows evaluation), mark-to-market (as IOU predictions, specially their growth). That is why IOU prices growth ratio is important. "
5150,Mid,aeternity,"I hate to say it, but I completely agree. I think the only ones who will get out alive are those that can dump their tokens ASAP on ED. Perhaps there will be a bright future, but short term outlook is most likely bleak."
5151,Mid,aeternity,I contribute in the first and in the second phase the same amount in ether. For me its the same. The ether I spent in the first is valuated today at us$350 just the same as the ether I spent in the second pahse. Lol
5152,Mid,aeternity,"You may discuss with an exchange ahead of time if there's new/different technology involved.As of now though it's just an ERC20 token.  It's trivial for any exchange to add it."
5153,Mid,aeternity,I'm waiting for weak hands to dump their shares. This will be fun to watch.
5154,Mid,aeternity,"I bought into phase 1 and I'm not going to sell my shares, in fact I believe that there will be a huge market for AE on Q1 of 2018. If the price crashes I will be accumulating more over time, and it will definitely pay."
5155,Mid,aeternity,"1) BTC contributions were calulated acording ETH price at the time. Do your own math. 2) This has nothing to do with initial $/ae ratio 3) IOU prices are artificially completely distorted and never reflect true market prices when (if) ae-coins are finally released. edit: Due to this huge spread, basically, i think phase 2 contributers are fucked. Reason/Scenario: (if) phase 1 contributers (who, btw, own a majority of tokens) are significally dumping right after release (and still make a good gain...), this then will lead to a dumping of weak-hand phase 2 contributers which is followed by a panic-sell of money-oriented phase 1ers resulting in a subsequent crash b/c there are probably (due to the severe team fuck-ups and bad rep) not alot of sideliners waiting to jump into this project anymore (check other subs... ae has more or less a plaguelike-status atm, unfortunately). It all depends on how much ae will drop in the first days/hours after being listed on exchanges. I think this scenario might unfold if the price drops below  $0.35..  -this will be very interesting dynamics to watch. There will be blood!"
5156,Mid,aeternity,Thank you for your feedback!
5157,Mid,aeternity,"But 1) there were not ETH only, but BTC too, 2) most of collected ETH were stolen and other expenditures has been made so reason for such evaluation looks not clear, 3) ""market capitalisation"" is $0.9368 per IOU Ae just now..."
5158,Mid,aeternity,"Ok, I was thinking it may be easy to create some templates of the most commonly used contracts with instructions on your website of how to fill in the blanks etc. I am not sure how much work you have ahead of you but thought this could save time. "
5159,Mid,aeternity,If you forgot the password and did not make a paper backup of your key then there's not much we can do. Your tokens are lost. You could try here but there are no guarantees https://walletrecoveryservices.com/ 
5160,Mid,aeternity,I do see smart contracts used widely and think the language has to be user-friendly. The complication is in actually implementing said language as there are few contracts to rewrite.
5161,Mid,aeternity,"regulators follow reality, no need to call them as derivatives, but  the smart contracts could be ""real options""..."
5162,Mid,aeternity,"Don't take too much stock in the 'disgruntled' participants. They are either people blowing off steam due to limited information coming in, or just new to investing. Not trying to berate them but you have to do your own research. I'm long on Aeternity. I could care less what the price is in the short term, although I'm sure there will be ups and then crashes. Invest what you feel comfortable in and resist doubting your decision. On the part about tokens, you just have to wait for them to be released. The more exchanges (over time) that start having them, the more volume and hopefully better price you'll be able to sell at"
5163,Mid,aeternity,maybe two weeks~~
5164,Mid,aeternity,"Hey Joel. You mentioned previously that you are moving away from chalang as you donäó»t believe it to be user friendly. Noting what Zack has said below, do you still think this is necessary? How large do you estimate the body of work to be to move to another smart contract language?[äóñ]agorism1337 2 points 2 months ago Hi I wrote the testnet, and I wrote the chalang VM. I don't expect users to use Chalang almost ever. There will be between 3 and 10 contracts that will be popular, and the same contract will be reused every time. A contract for betting on a football game is identical to a contract for betting on a political election. A contract for betting on the price of bitcoin is identical to a contract betting on the price of gold.I will write all the contracts, I don't need help writing them."
5165,Mid,aeternity,"Thank you. Seems like  there are more meaningful and synegetic aepps preferably needed in aeternity system. I don't think voting and betting function represented in your blog posts are of vital importance. Maybe some other application contexts to be realized are more crucial in your business roadmap.Anyway, thanks for your time Joel."
5166,Mid,aeternity,"I forget my ""MyEtherWallet"" password, so I sent an email about this problem to ""info@aeternity.com"".However I didn't receive reply yet..""info@aeternity.com"" is your team's address?If it's right just let me know what I have to do for this.I already emailed my NEW ADDRESS that I want to receive AE token!Please check ""info@aeternity.com"" and answer me!!!"
5167,Mid,aeternity,"Well, I've seen some other projects discussing with the exchanges in advance and communicating to the community before these are released, hence my post.It's not only about releasing the coin and hoping for an exchange to pick it up."
5168,Mid,aeternity,I think this time its coming!!! I really wish they will alocate the tokens this month! At Slack it seems they are close to doing it.
5169,Mid,aeternity,"That would be the only option, I must say."
5170,Mid,aeternity,"Haha, yes. Sorry. Not sure how ok would that be from a regulatory perspective. But I am not even sure I get it :)"
5171,Mid,aeternity,Better late than never!
5172,Mid,aeternity,Weren't you the one ranting and hating upon this project yesterday?
5173,Mid,aeternity,"Wow, that was a long sentence :D Maybe. :D "
5174,Mid,aeternity,Please answer this figure $0.45 - where is it from? Why not $0.93 as it is in IOU trading now at https://hitbtc.com/exchange/AE-to-BTC (minus premium)?
5175,Mid,aeternity,"Due to all the uncertaintiy, I doubt it will be listed on major exchanges. But some minor ones will list it."
5176,Mid,aeternity,Just now hitBTC price is about $0.92/AE ... $0.50 or $0.60 per AE means implied premium is about 45%-35% of hitBTC price...
5177,Mid,aeternity,"Nah, I can manipulate hitBTC prices to 0.6.  Looking for 0.5."
5178,Mid,aeternity,how is anyone sending anything?
5179,Mid,aeternity,I am willing to sell 15k tokens for anything in between 0.55 and 0.6$ after the tokens are distributed.
5180,Mid,aeternity,How can you sell the tokens before they are distributed?
5181,Mid,aeternity,I can sell it to you 14190 tokens for the price of 0.60 each.
5182,Mid,aeternity,"Trading of IOU is here https://hitbtc.com/exchange/AE-to-BTC ? "
5183,Mid,aeternity,The owner of the aepps that charges for the services will receive your tokens. If you bet then you receive more tokens if you win and lose your tokens to the other person otherwise.
5184,Mid,aeternity,"This is the part that I'm still completely ignorant on with regard to Aeternity. In other ICO's that I've been involved with, I currently have tokens that I'm able to move but which haven't appeared on an exchange yet. Is that the case with Aeternity? I don't know. That's part of what I'm trying to discover here since there seems to exist so many disgruntled participants that *may* be holding tokens which they can transfer prior to implementation on any exchanges. "
5185,Mid,aeternity,How would this trade work before tokens are released though? Will the person selling the future tokens be giving out the private key of their address and promise to not spend the tokens as soon as they are released?
5186,Mid,aeternity,who will receive the token? other users? If I particiapate in betting service I will pay for other participants?
5187,Mid,aeternity,"-.-$.50 sounds reasonable at that buy volume assuming:  1. The tokens are active and actually able to be traded currently.  2. The market exists for people who would like to cash out around this price point.   3. There is a trusted party or service that would facilitate the exchange. I would offer slightly higher ($.55 or $.60?), at much lower buy quantity, just to get my foot in the door and help FUDsters with their exit. I'm not interested in looking at or working with futures markets - just person to person with an acceptable intermediary for immediate exchange. "
5188,Mid,aeternity,"Well I've got $20,000 on the sidelines for anyone who wants to sell at $0.50 per token, so accepting all offers.  Looking to buy up to 40,000 tokens.PM me with a feasible trade plan (escrow) if interested.Users are pissed off at the clownish dev team, not the product."
5189,Mid,aeternity,The idea is that services will be provided by aepps on the Aeternity blockchain. These services will need to be paid for. AE above stands for the Aeternity Token (aeon) that's used to pay for services provided by the aepps.
5190,Mid,aeternity,"To be honest, I really need to re-read the white paper and give myself a refresher on what interested me in the first place. I'm relatively new to Reddit and just had the thought an hour ago of searching for an Aeternity board and that's when I saw a lot of disgruntled users. What do you propose is a decent price point given white paper vs community sentiment and no exchange available for trades? $0.25 / token?"
5191,Mid,aeternity,What do you offer per ae-token?
5192,Mid,aeternity,You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how this works.
5193,Mid,aeternity,The comments on etherscan are stating that it's a scam address and the total number of tokens is somewhere around 270 million. 
5194,Mid,aeternity,Aside from the comments you mentioned
5195,Mid,aeternity,"Why does it looks like a scam to you? It has 98mill AE tokens and the token name is Aeternity. It is also on the ETH mainnet.Not that I'm 100% sure it's the real one but I want to know what makes you think it's a scam address?"
5196,Mid,aeternity,It's a scam address. Read the comments.
5197,Mid,aeternity,"Of course. I just have no idea about how AE tokens transfer and or be awarded in the whole system.To be specific, there is a picture showing""weekly poker   -1AE"",""cash winnings   +12AE"",""proof of aexistence  -1AE"" I don't know why these process consume AE. Does AE only mean the symbol of money in Aeternity world for transactions in the mainnet? My questions are concerning about the business aspect, I am more aware of how and where AE can be used in aeternity world."
5198,Mid,aeternity,"Have you seen the blog posts on aepps? For example, [this one](https://blog.aeternity.com/proof-of-%C3%A6xistence-%C3%A6pp-537cfef8f774) and [this one](https://blog.aeternity.com/identity-manager-%C3%A6pp-465031fa9721). Do they answer your question?"
5199,Mid,aeternity,"Do not forget the still on-going AMA session with Joel, regarding any technical questions you have about aeternity.https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeternity/comments/6vxiei/ama_session_with_joel_reymont_cto_of_í_ternity/"
5200,Mid,aeternity,"The team can not list token on any exchange, they will just distribute the token to the investors wallets. It's up to different exchanges to adopt a token if they want based on demand, profitability, etc. "
5201,Mid,aeternity,"I mean, what is the use of AE tokens in those aepps?  Is it the ""bonus""of every action or just the""identification"" of our entitlement in AE mainnet, such as, voting or betting?"

5235,Mid,aeternity,We have been working alongside Zack for quite some time now and understand the code. We felt that this is the right time to dump some accumulated and unwanted technical baggage. We are starting with a clean source code repository and will be bringing in pieces of code from the old repo as needed.
5236,Mid,aeternity,Rust is where it's at! And thank you :-)
5237,Mid,aeternity,"Iäó»ve been following your work ever since the early days of your Erlang poker server. Since then I have taken an interest in what programming languages you like to use. Although I donäó»t know you personally, you have always striked me as one searching for the right balance of practicality and the power/expressiveness of a language. You clearly have built systems that scale massively, so Iäó»m curious as to your current thoughts on languages. Back in 2014 you mention that you prefer Go these days over Erlang and for a while you had gone down the Ocaml route. I have tried Go, but I struggle with lack of expressiveness and verbosity compared to other languages. Perhaps this is where the practical portion of the equation trumps the power/expressiveness part."
5238,Mid,aeternity,"I wholeheartedly agree with this. I've been quietly watching on the sidelines as of late because I don't want to participate in adding to the negativity that currently exists. But I believe Aeternity is putting forth a great effort amidst these trying times.I will continue to support the team in its endeavors as long as they continue to put forth the effort to communicate. "
5239,Mid,aeternity,"Hello Joel¥_ëI am glad to see your new aepp demos but I wonder if it can be accepted by market. I have been sending several emails with my questions but no any of your reply satisfy me.Here it is: why you use AE to represent every action in aepps? I mean, as every AE represents real money, is it plausible to give users AE token bonus when they submit a photo image or complete their private information? Is it fair to us who pump money into crowdsale?"
5240,Mid,aeternity,"Referring to this quote from you in another thread: ""We are going to archive the current testnet repo and start a brand-new project at https://github.com/aeternity/epoch""So this means that all the prior AE blockchain development is being dumped?It's shocking to hear that the developer of an $80m-funded project walks away and all the code has to go as well. Is this down to IP issues / lack of any contracts or legal agreements?Is it because only Zack could understand the code?"
5241,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, me too"
5242,Mid,aeternity,"Are there any experienced blockchain developers working at aeternity? If so, who are they and what is their experience?"
5243,Mid,aeternity,"Correct. Remember that you can't just make a compatible VM, you need to keep it compatible and this is quite an effort!"
5244,Mid,aeternity,Same applies for other virtual machines of other blockchains I assume.
5245,Mid,aeternity,"Fairly difficult at the moment. It would also delay the release of the mainnet, something that we don't want. I'll file it as an option for the future."
5246,Mid,aeternity,"I understand that you don't want to fuel rumors that could destabilize Ethereum ecosystem, nevertheless how difficult would be such integration?"
5247,Mid,aeternity,I'll have to file your question for future reference. In the first version of the AE blockchain you should be able to state that the GPS coordinate of this or that is X and have that logged in the blockchain. You will need to _vote_ with a number of tokens on the fact being true (the Yes answer) and others may dispute your coordinates by claiming them as untrue (the No answer). 
5248,Mid,aeternity,"1. It's a different level of commitment on my part and a much higher responsibility. I certainly feel a new and heavier weight on my shoulders. I'm also working at a much higher level than before. Nowadays, I code less and plan more. Fortunately, we have a great team that I can delegate to. And I do get my hands dirty whenever I can!2. We are focused on [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) for the MVP. "
5249,Mid,aeternity,As soon as the mainnet launches. Current estimate is Q1 of 2018.
5250,Mid,aeternity,Above!
5251,Mid,aeternity,By properly planning the project and allocating enough resources to the implementation. This is the project board https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/projects/1 and the sprints will be here https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/milestones. We are still planning and will be adding tickets throughout next week. We'll also be updating the project board constantly. We are developing completely in the open!
5252,Mid,aeternity,"You are phrasing the question as if we had announced plans to make the EVM run on Aeternity. We have no such immediate plans that I'm aware of. That said, I will be researching this as it seems like a good idea to look into."

5264,Mid,aeternity,"I agree. He might have had philosophical differences with ICOs and may not have liked how things were being run after, but he was the CTO with some control. He did sign up to run an ICO and agreed to develop this project for the backers. At the very least, if he no longer wanted to do that for whatever reason, he should not have made such a vague and public statement hinting at wrongdoing. He should have walked away quietly and did his own thing or stayed and sorted it out. Vague accusations and github shenanigans feel like a kid kicking someone else's sand castle in a tantrum."

5268,Mid,aeternity,Check slack. Vlad is taking some volunteers to test the tokens distribution contract.
5269,Mid,aeternity,thank you
5270,Mid,aeternity,thanks
5271,Mid,aeternity,"I don't want to chime in on the criticism of the team here, but I am wondering: ""End of August"" for Token distribution means what exactly, considering its already the 26th? Is there a specific date? Or is this the general direction and it may as well be beginning of September? The latter would totally be fine with me, a few days more or less don't really matter, but it's important to know an exact date ahead of time in order to know when to watch the markets and all, e.g. to sell at a great price and re-buy later, or to instantly rebuy or whatever you prefer doing. Similarly, are there any specific exchanges to take up AE known as of now?"
5272,Mid,aeternity,"I'm going to be honest. It might actually be a good thing Zach left. My impression of him is hes a top-notch programmer who has some really novel ideas, but ever since day 1 of the ICO he was already disagreeing publicly with decisions from the aeternity team. They were doing an ICO and he comes on here saying ICOs are scams or he dislikes them. Then in the one of the AMA threads he says he wasn't officially working for Aeternity yet because they hadn't sent him a contract when he's listed as the LEAD DEV on their website. Can you imagine its your first day as a new company and your lead dev is out there criticizing your decisions already and telling everyone why you guys suck? The new guy they got is 3x better than Zach just for the fact that he is a team player so far."
5273,Mid,aeternity,What happened to the page where you could check a contribution wallet?
5274,Mid,aeternity,"1. How it feels to work for a company instead of being independent consultant for a long time?2. What programming languages and technologies are used to develop í_ternity blockchain project?"
5275,Mid,aeternity,"You should get in touch with Coinbase, since there is a high chance that we will not be able to do anything for Coinbase users. They will need to send you the AE tokens, once distributed."
5276,Mid,aeternity,im a coinbase sender..how i can get solution ?who is the distributer i should contact?
5277,Mid,aeternity,"Yes people who start crying scam pretty quickly are annoying and usually wrong.Butyour logic that we shouldn't hurt aeternity team's 'feelings' or they'd run away with our money is bollocks as well.They have a responsibility to keep the investors abreast of things going on with the project, and they've failed miserably at it so I won't shy away from calling them out on it.If they show a bit more 'professionalism' in handling the situation everyone would calm down."
5278,Mid,aeternity,"Congrats. Good to see a threads like this (and the other we have seen these  days). It's seem to be you are going in the right direction: empowered CTO, giving some order to your comunication channels. Congrats again. sadly,  the project has fallen in credibility already and your effords must be higher now to recover. Plese, please do not mess up with the token distribution. I don't care about the token itself actually but the distribution talks a lot about the organization.and... Where is Yani? is he the CEO or just the founder? Do you have a CFO? who is performing that role?"
5279,Mid,aeternity,"Little annoys me more than people tossing around the word ""scam"" as soon as they're not instantly handed a token that goes to x10 the day after the ICO.  It's childish, bratty, moronic,  and about as intelligent as dopes who throw out the term ""fake news"" at legitimate stories in the press that they simply don't like.Yes, aeternity has been slow out of the gate and has had a rocky start.  And it deserves being called out for those early examples of incompetence.  But it's IN NO SENSE OF THE WORD A ""SCAM"".I can't wait for the token release so those clowns can dump their interest and fuck off.Joel seems to have thankfully grabbed aeternity by the scrotum and given the project a good sense of direction.  It's a shame our complaints about the floundering around weren't addressed months ago, but better late than never.  I hope the upper management has the common sense to listen to him and do what he says - and pay him enough to stick around instead of letting good staff drift away like they did with Zack.Aeternity needs to be a grown-up project that doesn't attract day trading teenage boys who screech loudly if they don't get treated like whales or early investors.  The crypto kid crowd is fine for pump'n'dump ICOs on the Ethereum blockchain, but such a turn-off for anything with serious long-term aspirations like aeternity.So basically I agree 100%, and would gladly accept a general rule in all aeternity communications channels that describing the project as a ""scam"" will automatically result in deletion of the comment and banning the author.  That's not blocking valid criticism; it's banning trolls."

5282,Mid,aeternity,"Yeah can definitely agree. I'm confident they'll keep this up and investors will be happier, it'll just take time. How do you feel about the delayed token release? For me, I don't find it a big deal because I'd rather it be released with an awesome product rather than just having the tokens without being able to do anything with them. "
5283,Mid,aeternity,"aeternity has embedded oracles. On ethereum these are apps on top of the protocol which makes them less efficient.Plus state channels and embedded governance which are not available on the others (although ethereum announced plasma recently)"

5285,Mid,aeternity,"The whole team is doing their best. Did you get the chance to interact with Joel and ask him about any technical information you need?"
5286,Mid,aeternity,"Seems like this is definitely an approach in the right direction. This will hopefully take the stress off the table for a lot of investors, especially once we see some results on github."
5287,Mid,aeternity,"You've covered all the competitors I know of but as far as exchanges go, not sure if that's been announced yet. In terms of the tech compared to eth at least it improves on it and has a few extra features.

5322,Mid,aeternity,"Hi joel. Thanks for taking some time to do this. My question is concerning the use case for Aeternity now. Zach often spoke of how Aeternity was being made as a platform for betting. Seeing as how its obviously still an Oracle-based chain, I don't see this changing, but wanted to get your thoughts. Also, will the state-channel approach be preserved (in order to reduce blockchain bloat)?"
5323,Mid,aeternity,"The fact that your thread is up here speaks a lot about the alleged censorship you are talking about. If you are concerned why don't you ask about development in  the AMA with Joel and you might have some real answers."
5324,Mid,aeternity,"We already know that tokens are going to be distributed next week at the latest. They said multiple times by the end on August.This kind of delays are known long time before the deadline so I'm pretty confident they'll deliver.

5326,Mid,aeternity,"Harsh. This is not so true IMO: *With the money we gave you months ago, you should have by now at least ten great developers in your offices banging this product out.* It's not just a matter of how much cash you have in the bank to throw around. There's a shortage of skilled blockchain devs because it takes time to learn it. Plus, since dumb money is willing to fund to excess any idea that seems even vaguely viable, devs who are experts are lured into starting something totally new instead of joining a team. Hopefully this new CTO will keep things rolling forward for aeternity."
5327,Mid,aeternity,When token release on Ethereum blockchain?
5328,Mid,aeternity,:)
5329,Mid,aeternity,We'll try to develop the mainnet and the aepps in parallel and will likely release everything together.
5330,Mid,aeternity,"Interesting. I know its not legal advice ;-) In Germany, thats not really possible. Similarly, theres many US States where such a clause is unlawful, at least regarding common contracts (i.e. you not being a CEO or such). But also many where it is lawful, and quite strongly so. However, I guess it also always depends on the specifics and such, considering it's law. As in: You can write a lot in a contract, but the question is always to what extent its binding."
5331,Mid,aeternity,"We have a good team size for now. I was giving a forecast for the future, as asked. Coordination may not become an issue as I'm here to mitigate it. We have a backlog of tasks and will look into hiring more people if the backlog grows. My lighter side must be sulking outside my office door. I shall go find it soon."
5332,Mid,aeternity,I don't get it. Are you the CTO or the cleaning lady ?
5333,Mid,aeternity,"Which raises the obvious question: if coordination is a limiting factor, what steps are being taken to mitigate the inefficiencies going forward?  Would having everyone in one physical location ever become a reality?Any while nine women can't give birth to a baby in one month, is there a ""sweet spot"" where you have the optimal team size to produce the baby blockchain in the minimum amount of time?  Surely there's some aspect of efficient division of, ahem, ""labor""?And lastly, you seem ever so serious.  Is there a lighter side to Joel?"
5334,Mid,aeternity,The (technical) buck stops with me!
5335,Mid,aeternity,"Your background is impressive no doubt and I look forward to supporting you as our leader. Ever since you've taken over as CTO it feels like you've cemented a take-charge attitude that will help this community thrive.Interesting I'll have to take a look at those aspects of Tezos."

5344,Mid,aeternity,What is mun?
5345,Mid,aeternity,"Yes. We'll also grow the team as needed. We have the funds to do so but coordination becomes a problem as team size grows. Also, 9 women cannot give birth to a baby in 1 month. Throwing bodies at a problem is not always the right solution so we are being careful. You can always check the team size [here](https://github.com/orgs/aeternity/teams/core/members)."
5346,Mid,aeternity,the link to the team is broken. maybe not public yet?
5347,Mid,aeternity,"I'm a recent newcomer but also a very quick learner.

That said, I like what [Tezos](https://github.com/tezos/tezos) are doing with OCaml and formal verification."
5348,Mid,aeternity,We want to get the MVP out as quickly as possible. Truffle is nice but will come later. It's not likely to be ready before the first release of the blockchain.
5349,Mid,aeternity,"We have a core team of [6 people, including yours truly](https://github.com/orgs/aeternity/teams/core/members) and will expand it as needed. We are all senior Erlang developers.

We will discuss each issue on Github and decide whether to add it to the project board and schedule it for implementation. This is is the same workflow that we are using."
5350,Mid,aeternity,"I disagree to the extent that someone walks away and voluntarily and publicly flings mud and hints at problems without airing the actual dispute fully. I'm particularly critical when they intend to go out asking for more money from new investors.The Storj CTO did this as well. He also wrote a manifesto of sorts accusing management of all sorts of problems without  even giving the slightest thought to what his own role might have been in the issues with that company. He also launched a new project . To make it worse, he sold his stake in the project well before he nuked it. Obv Zack had nothing to sell in this case... But the basic point is the same. Not a classy way to act.It's not appropriate. It's particularly not appropriate to leave cryptic messages with veiled accusations that hint at malfeasance without any details. If you're going to blow the whistle, do it. If you're leaving for personal reasons, do it quietly and don't throw a tantrum."

5352,Mid,aeternity,"since I had the honor to test the aepp-prototypes (which are really great!):- is the plan to release them together with the mainnet?- will they all be released with mainnet or do you focus on the identity manager aepp first?"
5353,Mid,aeternity,"Chalang is a Forth dialect. Forth is very easy to implement but very user-unfriendly and not suitable for writing contracts at large. We don't have a lot of time to release our MVP so we need something that' reasonably easy to implement and more user-friendly than Forth. Ethereum had LLL, a Lisp-like language, before moving to Solidity. Lisp is straightforward to implement so I'm looking at something similar to [Kadena's Pact](http://kadena.io/pact/). We'll probably start with an untyped interpreter, proceed to add type inference and then implement a bytecode VM. I'm aware of the above languages and will be digging deeper into them as part of our implementation."
5354,Mid,aeternity,Maybe Zach's intentions are right. We shouldn't take sides without knowing the whole story. No CTO will ever leave a project without being profoundly against management practices. 
5355,Mid,aeternity,No.

5358,Mid,aeternity,"Hi there, and ofcourse there is most asked question, when we will get our tokens? Please also answer question regarding timeframes, if there will be future promises, can we relay on them that will be realised in time or as always with huge delay?"
5359,Mid,aeternity,I want to point out the part with the developer tools. Is there a plan to involve people building some framework like truffle (compared to ethereum)
5360,Mid,aeternity,"Hola Joel.  First of all, your positive influence is already hugely noticeable. My question is about the bridge (or, in the case of aeternity thus far, chasm) between the tech and the real world.  Until this point, it seems as if the team has utterly failed to understand that the moment they solicited huge sums of money from investors, the game changed. They needed to step outside of their bubble and start acting like a world class tech company rather than teenage boys coding in their bedrooms. Yet this hasn't happened.There has been little or no concern (or it certainly seems that way to everyone outside the confines of the aeternity office) about producing a blockchain on schedule, developing relationships with third parties, and making a significant impact on the crypto world.  And as a result, opportunities seem to have been missed. E.g. many upcoming ICOs are related to solving the issue of oracles and blockchain connectivity to the outside world, one of the key selling points of aeternity. Because aeternity has been slow, it's no longer going to have any first-to-market advantage. And even if the delays are inevitable, the organization has been silent when it comes to releasing marketing information to the world that would at least have mitigated any damage and put aeternity's stake in this territory.The team appears to have a bit of an ""aw shucks"" attitude and fails to understand the pace at which technology in this arena is progressing or how high the stakes have been raised now that the ICO has been completed.  Take the theft of the funds, for example.  The information released suggests to us that aeternity treated this as something as insignificant as losing twenty bucks while strolling around the mall. Sure, it was definitely a big deal to you all, but this wasn't conveyed.  I don't think an apology was even issued; all we saw was a general ""shit happens"" attitude.So, my point: what are you doing to impress upon the team that this isn't a game anymore, that it's a grown-up project with grown-up responsibilities?  What are you doing to bridge the gap between the tech side and the business side?This isn't Field of Dreams.  If you build it, they won't come. Someone (and preferably a world-class team of marketing and outreach professionals) needs to be out there pounding the pavement, banging on doors, and getting this product front and center on the desks of CTOs in businesses across the globe.  What steps is aeternity taking to engage the business community and encourage widespread adoption of aeternity?You can have the tightest blockchain ever, but we both know that even the best products need to be marketed properly.I'm happy to send you a box of Big Boy Pants for the team.  It's time they wore some.Thanks!"
5361,Mid,aeternity,"Hi Joel,How long have you been involved in the blockchain development space? are there any specific projects out there that you like and perhaps use as inspiration when working on í_ternity?"
5362,Mid,aeternity,So yeah I agree these startups should use good legal advisors. 
5363,Mid,aeternity,Non-compete clauses work perfectly in Switzetland. Even though it is open-source you could force someone to not work in the same project than you are working. As long it does not violate economic freedom (and other specifics cases) you can bind someone with a non-compete clause in Switzerland. (ps:this is not a legal advice etc etc for further information you should consult a professinal).
5364,Mid,aeternity,When will the Cuckooo cycle PoW be added to the testnet/epoch code? Will Aeternity continue to be developed exclusively in Erlang or will other language versions be available?
5365,Mid,aeternity,"Some questions about the development strategy:Could you tell us a bit about the structure of the team at the moment, and how the roles are distributed?Are you going to accept external contributions from the beginning, or is it too early? If so, how are you going to make it as easy as possible for newcomers (official workflow, being able to attend the standups, having the team discussing on a publicly accessible channel by default, etc.)?Do you have people dedicated to the developer tools / experience, or is it something that will come later?"
5366,Mid,aeternity,When is mun
5367,Mid,aeternity,"Besides, non-compete clauses are violating moral and therefore civil rights in much of the (civil law) world, surely in Switzerland, too. Rightly so! Having said that, IP is a different case but has been answered here already with regard to open source projects.What I'm wondering: Whats your source for this claim? Not like I doubt it, but I wonder whether there is any sort of more detailed source on this?"
5368,Mid,aeternity,"I definitely welcome a more open, transparent and regular communication policy of this project. You can't expect everybody to join your slack channel. You have to cater for more channels, such as twitter or reddit."
5369,Mid,aeternity,Is your team currently big enough to handle the challenges presented?

5374,Mid,aeternity,"Hi Joel! Itäó»s great that you are doing this AMA.I asked you this already, but I think it could be interesting to have a developed answer it here: Could you tell as where are the discussions regarding the language that is going to replace Chalang?

I have participated in the Slack channel and requested to be apart of the testing when they asked in the channel if anyone would like to provide feedback. I have contributed my comments after using a hosted and under development version of the design which you are referring to.
5391,Mid,aeternity,"Please come and join the slack channel instead of accusing me of being something, or saying something I'm not. I'm in the channel daily, and that is why I know what's going on.

That's not to say that there isn't room for improvement and the team needs to continue stepping things up. "
5392,Mid,aeternity,"True. And I am growing tired of devs who leave projects half finished. It's bad for their reputation and it should be. At least if they want to lead the project. Not everyone should / can be a CTO, even if they're brilliant. And that's okay."
5393,Mid,aeternity,"Even without such legal agreements (not sure you could or should have those in an open source project anyway), there are unwritten rules/moral code. I am assuming this guy who left the team will follow them. If not, his project is doomed anyway (smear campaign incoming)."
5394,Mid,aeternity,CPU or GPU cores? Or both?

Honestly, aeternity, how about you use some of those millions we gave you to hire EXPERIENCED professionals?  You know, like a serious business, not a college comp sci class project?)"
5405,Mid,aeternity,Does Cuckoo cycle involve the creation of anything similar to the Ethereum DAG?
5406,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, 4GB is expected to be as good.Instead of thinking of more memory you should think of getting more cores."
5407,Mid,aeternity,What do you see as the largest barriers to mass cryptocurrency adoption moving forward?
5408,Mid,aeternity,"Cuckoo Cycle is really no different with regards to pool ability from any other PoW. So yes, it will be possible, and will probably be quitepopular. Solo mining is preferable from a decentralization viewpoint of course..."
5409,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, the main motivation was to provide a good alternative to compute bound PoWs like bitcoin's, with potentially less centralization, as hardware investment costs would potentially dominate ongoing energy costs. But I considered scrypt to be a failure as verification cost grows with the memory use. So I wanted to combine requirements of huge memory use with instant verifiability. In the end, the arrival of faster bandwidth bound solvers makes it somewhat less egalitarian than a latency boud one."
5410,Mid,aeternity,"The slower latency bound solver has been ported to CUDA only, and the faster bandwidth bound solver still has to be ported to both CUDA and OpenCL."
5411,Mid,aeternity,"The part about incentivizing truly random access memory is true, but the rest is wishful thinking. GPUs will be way more efficient than CPUs and low power devices and mining will still suffer from centralization due to unequal geographical distribution of cheap electricity"
5412,Mid,aeternity,"Pool mining makes less sense to me, since that makes it less like a lottery and more like a guaranteed loss (unless your electricity is free). "
5413,Mid,aeternity,"Yes, you should definitely be able to run multiple GPUs in concert, each working on its own instances. Just like with any other PoW. There's no way you can tell how many GPUs are really behind an IP address..."
5414,Mid,aeternity,Or pool mining on mobile phones while charging?
5415,Mid,aeternity,"Aeternity should definitely fund a port of the solver to iOS and Android, preferrably as a native app. We should figure out just how a phone compares in performance per watt."
5416,Mid,aeternity,"Is this quote on point?> ""The ""Cuckoo Cycle"" PoW is more power efficient and indirectly useful, as it encourages the development of better random access memory (DRAM) chips. Even low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops can efficiently mine new tokens. This will achieve an unparalleled decentralisation and geographical distribution of the mining power, which will be crucial to the success of any Blockchain.""Source: https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/wiki/Mining#proof-of-work-mining---which-kind-of-hardware-is-best"
5417,Mid,aeternity,"A mobile device will have much lower performance, but there is still hope if you look at performance per watt. The challenge is mostly convincing people to run a miner on their phone while it's charging overnight with extremely small odds of making money. Instead it should be approached as a way to play the lottery. A lottery which has no small prizes, only one big prize every so many minutes (winning a block reward)."
5418,Mid,aeternity,"Dude, you have no patience. You are not fit for investing. Maybe next time go to a casino. you can cash out there any time."
5419,Mid,aeternity,All your answers are appreciated!!! Thank you very much for this AMA!!! :)
5420,Mid,aeternity,Are these cuda enabled gpu? Or it doesnäó»t matter
5421,Mid,aeternity,"Did you develop cuckoo cycle with the purpose of mining decentralization?With an egalitarian purpose in mind?"
5422,Mid,aeternity,The RAM needs to be coupled to sufficiently many computing cores that can exhaust all its bandwidth. For that GPUs are much better equipped than CPUs. This may change if CPUs come equipped with many dozens (64+) of cores. But that seems far in the future...
5423,Mid,aeternity,"Not likely, as any increase in performance will probably be negated by the large development and particularly production costs of such non-commodity hardware."
5424,Mid,aeternity,Does that mean one can use multiple 4GB GPUs in different PCI-E slots on one motherboard and run an instance on each? I believe it was mentioned  that only one miner would be allowed to run per IP address for aeternity.
5425,Mid,aeternity,"Older and mobile cards will offer much less memory bandwidth, and thus much less Cuckoo Cycle hashpower. Some mobile cards may still offer a decent performance per Watt though..."
5426,Mid,aeternity,"Like I mentioned in another answer, you need at least about 3GB, but additional RAM beyond 4GB is not expected to help much."
5427,Mid,aeternity,"For the mortals... Normal people...Will pool mining be possible?Will pool mining be advisable?Or is everyone somehow better of solo mining?"
5428,Mid,aeternity,"Possibly, but it's really hard to predict. In terms of centralization it should be close to how Ethereum behaves, with its similarly memory bandwith bound mining."
5429,Mid,aeternity,General RAM (not graphic card) will be needed very little? Meaning 4 GB will be as good as 16 GB?
5430,Mid,aeternity,"I think it will take at least 50, maybe a 100 smartphones to match the hashing power of a GPU. So it's possible that they contribute a nontrivial fraction of hashing power, but there would need to be a LOT of them active..."
5431,Mid,aeternity,CPU will be mostly idle?
5432,Mid,aeternity,Do you think mining with mobile devices (smartphones...) could make up for a realistic share of the hash power? Or will these be like a drop in the ocean vs mining farms?
5433,Mid,aeternity,"You won't be able to mine efficiently with only 2GB. You really need to have at least a few % more. The current solver uses a little over 2.2GB. Now, if you have an 8GB card, you could in principle try to solver 2 or 3 instances at the same time. However, it's likely that even one instance already exhausts most of the entire memory bandwidth of the GPU, in which case the other instances will bring very diminished returns."
5434,Mid,aeternity,Do you think cuckoo mining will result in less centralization? (Like what's happening in China with centralization of Bitcoin ASIC mining.)
5435,Mid,aeternity,"Hello john.How exactly does RAM limit the GPU's performance on Cuckoo cycle. Is there an optimal configuration RAM v/s GPU?"
5436,Mid,aeternity,Alright but I know anybody that can solve mining on phone RAM effectively would be extremely rich!
5437,Mid,aeternity,"What about graphic cards with 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB or whatever amount of memory... Will these scale up linear and mine faster than 2 GB?Or is RAM above 2 GB per card just obsolete for mining?"
5438,Mid,aeternity,Nope I asked John no reply is acceptable.
5439,Mid,aeternity,Will old/slow/mobile graphic cards with a lot VRAM mine almost as good as fast graphic cards with an equal amount of VRAM?
5440,Mid,aeternity,"Phone mining was considered an almost viable option when it looked like solving Cuckoo Cycle was inherently latency bound. But in the past few months, thanks to xenoncat (who claimed a big bounty), we know that by using an order of magnitude more memory, it becomes bandwidth bound (and 4x faster). Phones are not at all competitive when it comes to memory bandwidth...And RAM by itself is not that useful. You also need to connect lots of computing cores to it so thatyou can exhaust its memory bandwidth. This is what GPUs are really good at, with their hundreds or thousands of computing cores."
5441,Mid,aeternity,"This may answer your question, from Joel:- ""This does not preclude AE from running on the phone, though. It does exclude a non-Erlang implementation that may come down the road. The first version of the AE blockchain code will not run on the phone but the algorithms used, e.g. Cuckoo Cycle, will allow for this down the road.""We should wait for a node written in other language "
5442,Mid,aeternity,Do you think there will be FPGA or ASIC mining?
5443,Mid,aeternity,You're a class act.  Thank you!
5444,Mid,aeternity,"I expect most mining will be GPU based, as it will be an order of magnitude faster than CPUs. So, I don't see much use for VMs."
5445,Mid,aeternity,"Fair enough.  Apologies for my tone; I think most of us are used to being given the runaround by the prior aeternity staff (if we were even lucky enough to get an answer!)  The straightforward honesty from you is refreshing and much-needed at the moment.Keep up with the ass-kicking and name-taking!"
5446,Mid,aeternity,The fastest solver will need just over 2GB of memory with the recommended size of a 1-billion node graph. There is also a much slower algorithm that needs less than 200MB.
5447,Mid,aeternity,"Will cuckoo cycle needs depend on general RAM or graphic card RAM?If graphic card RAM, in a nutshell, why not general RAM?"
5448,Mid,aeternity,"I don't recall exactly how I got the idea. But in late 2013 I was looking at a PoW called momentum and looking for harder problems than the birthday paradox it was based on, which seemed to me to offer to much choice in how to go about finding solutions. Indeed, that was later found to be essentially broken. Cuckoo Cycle  is directly inispired by Cuckoo Hashing, a hashtable implementations technique that I was quite familiar with, and can be seen as a generalization of Momentum, which just looks for 2-cycles (cycles of length 2). So Cuckoo Cycle has claim to being the first asymmetric PoW that's not broken. And it's also the first one from graph theory, like Primecoin was the first in Number Theory."
5449,Mid,aeternity,"I dont have much to ask on this, my impression of your algorithm is I can mine on phone, as I dont have time to undertand its technicality. My plan was to buy up pieces of RAM before to mine aeternity. Correct me anywhere possible telling me its limitation and why Joel is saying that mining on phone is not achievable in the nearest future, thank you. Answer this"
5450,Mid,aeternity,"Hey John, how suited is Cuckoo for mining on mobile devices? What are the challenges?"
5451,Mid,aeternity,Another question is what garauntees a miner receives a reward and how profitable would it be
5452,Mid,aeternity,"""Why choose aeternity to implement this, as opposed to other blockchains in development?""- I think he can't choose who wants to use his algorithm. It's open source."
5453,Mid,aeternity,DDR4 has advantages in power efficiency and bandwidth.
5454,Mid,aeternity,"Since the Cuckoo Cycle solver shares many characteristics with the Equihash solver, we can expect the best hardware to be similar. That points to the NViDIA 1080 and 1070 variants...One difference is that cuckoo30 will takes over 2GB whereas Equihash as deployed by ZCash needs only 144MB to solve efficiently (as my own equihash solver demonstrated)"
5455,Mid,aeternity,"alright, good "
5456,Mid,aeternity,"What is ""cloud cuckoo"" ?"
5457,Mid,aeternity,"I didn't choose aeternity, they chose Cuckoo Cycle. When they did so, it looked more egalitarian than it does now."
5458,Mid,aeternity,"The new CTO really gets this. And yes, we are in this together."
5459,Mid,aeternity,"aexasperated, thanks for the comment. it is one of the more insightful ones that I have seen recently. I have forwarded it to the team."
5460,Mid,aeternity,"I will not be involved in any aspects of aeternity other than use of cuckoo cycle, including things like parameter choice."
5461,Mid,aeternity,"Aeternity will not be the only coin using Cuckoo Cycle. The bottom of the project page at mentions a few others. Some others that plan to use it have told me in confidence and have yet to be publicized."
5462,Mid,aeternity,"It is better than most other memory intensive PoWs in that proofs are instantly verifiable with no use of memory. Memory is only needed for finding proofs."
5463,Mid,aeternity,It's true.
5464,Mid,aeternity,That blog post then goes on to explain the simple edgetrimming algorithm which identifies useless roads by counting how many roads connect to each city. A city to which only one road connects is a dead end that cannot be part of a cycle.
5465,Mid,aeternity,What's the best hardware for mining?
5466,Mid,aeternity,Will it be more economic to mine using DDR3 vs DDR4 RAM?
5467,Mid,aeternity,"Hi John,Can you please explain how and why you founded this algorithm and why you think it adds value to the PoW process?"
5468,Mid,aeternity,"I dont have much to ask on this, my impression of your algorithm is I can mine on phone, as I dont have time to undertand its technicality. My plan was to buy up pieces of RAM before to mine aeternity. Correct me anywhere possible telling me its limitation and why Joel is saying that mining on phone is not achievable in the nearest future, thank you."
5469,Mid,aeternity,"There's a pretty good explanation of Cuckoo Cycle in the blog post at http://cryptorials.io/beyond-hashcash-proof-work-theres-mining-hashing/I quote ""In Cuckoo Cycle, proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle (loop) in a large random graph defined by some nonce. Imagine two countries, each with a billion cities, and imagine picking a billion border crossing roads that connect a random city in one country to a random city in the other country (the PoW actually uses a cheaply computed hash function to map the nonce, road number, and country to a city). We are asked if there is cycle of 42 roads visiting 42 different cities. If someone hands you a nonce and 42 road numbers, it is indeed easy to verify, requiring negligible time and memory.""(boy, reddit seems troublesome. my browser shows lots of ""waiting for reddit.com"" and sometimes when i try to submit a comment i get ""an error occurred"")"
5470,Mid,aeternity,With how much RAM per computer the CPU will get starting the bottleneck?
5471,Mid,aeternity,Are there any restrictions or do you foresee any performance loss when mining using Virtual Machines (VMs)?
5472,Mid,aeternity,"Hello, aeternitters. This is John, inventor of Cuckoo Cycle.Let me go and answer these questions one by one..."
5473,Mid,aeternity,"Hello. Thanks for doing this Q&A.Here goes:- Can you explain your mining algorithm like I'm 12 please?  (This is for me to confirm my understanding is correct, but also to ensure that others can get the ""elevator pitch"" too.)- How is it ""better"" than other algorithms currently used?  What are the advantages?  Downsides?- Are any other similar algorithms out there, particularly any being used or implemented by other blockchains?- Will aeternity be the only blockchain using this algorithm?- How involved will you be with the aeternity team?- Why choose aeternity to implement this, as opposed to other blockchains in development?- The name: why choose Cloud Cuckoo?"
5474,Mid,aeternity,Good idea. Thanks.

5476,Mid,aeternity,I was just restating the original plan. We are in a transition period  after development team changes.
5477,Mid,aeternity,"That's better.  Thank you.But item 1 in the meeting notes is frightening: ""Deliver on the vision in the original whitepaper, i.e. implement payment channels, oracles and smart contracts.""  Was that not the plan before it was addressed front and center in the meeting?  Had the aeternity project morphed into something else until you got on board to refocus the team?"
5478,Mid,aeternity,"If you had posted this in their slack, you wouldve gotten banned.this dev team 0 communication, 0 product, 100% censorship."
5479,Mid,aeternity,"We are going to archive the current testnet repo and start a brand-new project at https://github.com/aeternity/epoch. Weäó»ll transfer code, update the wiki, create projects, etc. over the next few days. Youäó»ll be able to track our progress there as weäó»ll be doing the same.

5480,Mid,aeternity,"Spot on friend. Right now Joel has done a fantastic job of taking the reins as acting CTO but it can't stop there. I'm sure Yani is doing more than most realize in terms of establishing the foundation and making connections but it would be in everyone's interest for Yani to avail himself to the community and discuss his progress regarding the different jobs he is handling. Transarency and trust go a very long way. I envision Joel being a very good leader so let's give him the resources he needs to make this project the success it ought to be. "
5481,Mid,aeternity,"Agreed. Though from what's going on, I think they're getting this. Frankly, I think the new CTO really gets this. More than anyone else I've heard from on the teamOn a related note, team Aeternity, many of your backers work work with startups and tech companies large and small. When we give advice or recommendations we know a thing or two as well. Please use the community because we're invested in your success... Literally."
5482,Mid,aeternity,"Joel, the new CTO,answered a lot of questions and came off looking like he understands building a functioning dev team and having a clear timeline and roadmap are critical. Came off looking good IMHO.  They are also having daily dev meetings and sharing action items on git.So far, August token release date is holding but no additional details."
5483,Mid,aeternity,100% agree
5484,Mid,aeternity,"Great!IMO you should add an ""UPDATE:"" with a timestamp or just a timestamp on its own, whenever you add something. Without reading the comments, I don't think many people realise there was an update "
5485,Mid,aeternity,Might even be kinda interesting :)
5486,Mid,aeternity,"Seriously, can't somebody give a quick summary or something? Whats with all the secrecy?"
5487,Mid,aeternity,AMA might not hurt...
5488,Mid,aeternity,"New guy does seem professional and they seem to be trying to get their shit together. He should do an AMA here. It's hard to say how much Zach's departure hurts. He's certainly an important piece of what's been built to date, but I do genuinely like what I'm hearing from Joel and think he has a more mature outlook on developing such a large project."
5489,Mid,aeternity,Scam. You not see your tokens. 
5490,Mid,aeternity,I just updated the FAQ.
5491,Mid,aeternity,Obviously information does not propagate efficiently. We have provided comments on all mentioned issues. I will update the sticky FAQ. Not sure if people will read that. (hope so)
5492,Mid,aeternity,"In order to receive a Slack invite, please send a mail to info@aeternity.com"
5493,Mid,aeternity,The team is definitely not bailing out of the project :) The money will be spent accordingly.
5494,Mid,aeternity,"Is that confirmed somewhere? I also want the tokens. It feels like they don't have their stuff together. So much negative things that happen.When the tokens are released I expect a massive sell off, or an extremely low price."
5495,Mid,aeternity,One more week though
5496,Mid,aeternity,"By the way, the aepps you mention are just at the mockup drawing stage!! That usually happens in the first couple of weeks of a project. We are half way through the projected timeline of the project and no sign of any coding even beginning on them. Are there even any mobile developers?"
5497,Mid,aeternity,"The last thing we need is someone denying reality to pump up their token price so they can bail out as soon as the tokens go live. Or a shill, whichever you are.By repeating the team mantra that everything is fine, you are simply helping to prevent any reform from happening and this dire situation will just get deeper and darker.The root problem is the management are not running a serious project and are not willing to spend our cash to build the product. Is there even any management, I'm not sure."
5498,Mid,aeternity,"They have a new CTO, Joel Reymont. This guy is fantastic and a step in the right direction. He is active and communicating with the community in the Slack channel and taking AE forward in the right direction. Token distribution is happening this month and with only a week left to go, expect to see your tokens very shorty. Aepps have gone through user testing and some of the concepts look fantastic. They have recently partnered up with a Bulgarian based educational institution to aid in the training and learning of blockchain development also.Everything is looking good at the moment and I can see AE heading in the right direction with a bunch of different teams working on the different areas.Zack's participation is still being discussed (I've heard an update regarding this will happen once his intentions moving forward are known), however I recommend you jump in the Slack channel and have a listen or post any technical questions to Joel, you will be impressed.*Note: I'm not involved with AE, just keeping up to date and watching everything take steps forward via the channels."
5499,Mid,aeternity,What is being informed in Slack that isnt here?
5500,Mid,aeternity,Whats in Slack that isnt here????
5501,Mid,aeternity,"u/vdramaliev Should be able to get you an invite to the Slack group. To me, that is where the most info besides Telegram has been presented recently."
5502,Mid,aeternity,Nope. They sould still send out emails or something. What if someone does not know about a slack group? EMAILLLLLL

5509,Mid,aeternity,Cool. Both sound great. Thanks for doing this.
5510,Mid,aeternity,The Ron Paul bit was a nice touch
5511,Mid,aeternity,Im agree with the request. A healthy project must have high transparency standard. You should work as a Publicly traded company in term of transparency or maybe a pick up a ISO standar... something please!!!!
5512,Mid,aeternity,"A Q&A with Joel, the new CTO will be organized next week."
5513,Mid,aeternity,I have forwarded this request to the team.
5514,Mid,aeternity,You are trying to be a professional scammer :)

5517,Mid,aeternity,Yoi
5518,Mid,aeternity,Ok thanks Vlad. Could we get information in the blog post about how this will affect the development of the aeternity blockchain and if this will set back the timeline for mainnet launch.
5519,Mid,aeternity,"Ok, so what I was able to get out as info from the team is that Zack will continue his work on his own, we have a new CTO and the team is preparing an official statement regarding the dev team, including partnerships and a lot of new tech talent.

5536,Mid,aeternity,Google cache shows he was https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:k0w7SmLsyaYJ:https://github.com/aeternity+&cd=1&hl=fr&ct=clnk&gl=fr

5540,Mid,aeternity,Do you know for sure that he was ever in that member list? Because none of the other code contributors are in that list. Maybe only Yani was ever there?
5541,Mid,aeternity,cool thank you
5542,Mid,aeternity,Zack must not leave the team oh. Please aeternity please let all this be over!
5543,Mid,aeternity,"Hey, I asked one of our legal advisers to provide you with a reply."
5544,Mid,aeternity,"Everyone, I will check back with the team and will let you know what is happening."
5545,Mid,aeternity,He has been removed from the official Aeternity repository https://github.com/aeternity. I think he will continue to build aeternity according to his vision. This also confirms that there are issues in the company which they are not sharing with us. I hope i get my tokens before the end of this month.
5546,Mid,aeternity,i also want to know this question there's many people in china that has discussed this 
5547,Mid,aeternity,Last commit by Zack was 3 days ago. I think you call that the weekend. 
5548,Mid,aeternity,"Knowing how Zach has communicated his intentions in the past, I don't think he has left the project. This is just my opinion.I believe the last time this was brought up he stated his current status was working with the Aeternity team for 3 years. I'm looking for the source of this on Reddit at the moment but on mobile. (I suck with mobile Reddit.) That being said, hopefully himself or someone from the Aeternity team can give more insight soon.Edit: wording and grammar."
5549,Mid,aeternity,"Fixing some bugs in the site should never be allowed to block fixing the certificate. People (like me) may have bookmarked the url and still navigate to the wallet site. Because it is still publicly available people are getting the invalid certificate message all the time. It happens, just take a look at the daily remarks in the í_ternity Slack. It is insecure to keep the wallet site available under an invalid certificate. After a while people may get used to it and start ignoring the certificate error, creating all kind of opportunities for technical as well as social engineering attacks. This is considered bad practice."
5550,Mid,aeternity,wow... just wow. What a circus this is!! Incredible...

5553,Mid,aeternity,Sure I will re-send the original email.  Thanks.
5554,Mid,aeternity,Hello. We have not received your mails. We received one from 6 hours ago which is the same as the info on your website. Please re-send and we can discuss. Please mention the people who are involved in this project.
5555,Mid,aeternity,"Ok you got us, it was actually unveiled precisely 12 hours before the peak of the eclipse, at 3:26:40pm Tokyo time.  There is also some kind of caching problem because that text on the site was changed some time ago to say ""during the solar eclipse"".  Anyway, apologies for the imprecision.  We had considered sending someone to Cerulean, Kentucky underneath the greatest extent of the eclipse but felt that it was not necessary :)Best Regards,"

5557,Mid,aeternity,Actually we did try to contact you but unfortunately have not yet been able to get through.  We initially reached out via facebook and were then told to email info & niko addresses instead.  We did so but then received no follow up replies.  Anyway we understand that you guys have been very busy.  Shall we catch up this week?  Unless you would like us to switch over to Ethereum?  Hehehe... :)

5565,Mid,aeternity,Im one more dude skeptical regarding their promise to deliver their tokens on this month. They have dissapeared from everywhere in the social media. I think they will come with another bullshit excuse in the end of this month and they will let us without any precise date until 2018.

5584,Failure,superdao,">y post on slack plus some other questions. I see that Esco Obong (@escobyte) is part of the team which is great but I do not see any posts about this project on his twitter, facebook or Linkedin. If you are all launching in 35 days, is your team going to begin promoting and posting? Or are there other promotion plans that you have?    At the risk of re-answering what patrick already and you seeing responses from sufficient members of the team, I ll just go ahead and comment for deeper clarification.    - About esco like I responded to you on slack its not a requirement that every team member advertise their association with the organization, I cannot force them. Surely you must understand this? The idea here of the organization here is of a loose and concrete associative paradigm, devs are free to participate as they would, but each person be rewarded according to participation, that goes true for the rest of new developers from the ETC community that might be looking to participate in SuperDAO. Nevertheless I told Esco to tweet at you and you can see that here : https://twitter.com/escobyte/status/796831085275611136.  >Is pokereum finished or was that demo just a rendering of what it will look like in the future? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqsLi2CAgQ  - On Pokereum. NO what you see is not a ""rendering"" or whatever that means. What you see there is an actual decentralized poker p2p client in progress from hundreds of dedicated developer man hours on a shoe-string budget. We are close to a usable product as you will see from our roadmap. Later today we will release a first stage p2p library component for decentralized poker, that other projects can tweak and use in their own decentralized poker projects  i.e projects like consensys since one of the first guys joe tried to recruit and I have not seen the tech reproduced.

Mind you this post was up there till about a couple of weeks ago. More concealing of history. This was after showing joe the pokereum demo client, he sent me to a layer ""his friend"" to threaten me, start is own project and proceeded to slander with his influence. I still have the emails, if a need for proof comes . Luckily I have links and saved pictures : [ Joe to delete pokereum ](http://i.imgur.com/jG830pD.png).

If this was a conscious decision to not build a following, why?   - We are close to ~12 -14 core members for now, some with varying levels of participation but I am sure they will be updating there profiles on the website shortly. and some About marketing and Hype was not the first thing that came to mind. The crowd funding itself will draw the necessary audience it needs. Again any of my colleages feel free confirm that here  .

5585,Failure,superdao,"Can you please post this reply and any other answers in the following reddit thread.https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5c42p5/superdao_introduction_community_bounties/Thank you"
5586,Failure,superdao,"Hi Carlo, In respect to the company I worked for, It is a Nigerian based compliance company. You can check them out http://www.obriencompliance.com"
5587,Failure,superdao,"Hi Carlo, I'll take a stab at answering some of these.I've been working on this project almost from the beginning, so while I may not have all the depth that some others would, I should be able to make up for it with breadth.* There will be increased promotions between now and the launch. Everyone on the team has been been very tight-lipped about the project up to now b/c of some bad run-ins in the past. I'd be worried if you did hear/see something about this from Esco before now.* Pokereum is still a WIP. It's under active development, and you can think of that video as a ""current state of UX"". Have a look at our roadmap to get a sense of our timeline (alpha aiming for w21).* The whitepaper was actually previously released, but we got a lot of feedback (both good and bad) and we are actively working on updating it. Should definitely be out before SuperDAO launch.* Per #1, we chose to deliberately not make any public mentions before now. The reasoning was that if we announced too early, people might get impatient with the team while we worked on things; and the management of input & feedback would chew up hours we could (did) spend on our core foundation. Case in point, it took a fair bit of time for me to write this reply.* That pitch deck is not intended for public consumption. It was used as part of our private meetings with early backers to fund the pre-announcement work. You found that b/c (to the best of our knowledge) emaze doesnäó»t allow us to hide these things, just lock them. We probably wonäó»t release **that** deck, but there will be plenty of stuff (including threads like this) that will more than compensate for it.* Again, going back to the first point: we didnäó»t want to make any public announcements until certain team milestones were achieved.* Yeah, I hear what you are saying. We could go back and forth all day on the merits of different strategies. Bottom line, it was just the strategy we chose to release. Personally, I think 35 days is more than enough for us to hit our targets & goals.* We are all available via Reddit and weäó»d prefer that (at least for the time being) all correspondence related to SupperDAO are kept out in the open äóñ like here on Reddit. It helps keep our time and focus at maximum efficiency.Hope these answers help! Let us know if you have any follow-up questions."
5588,Failure,superdao,Could you please answer some or all of the questions?  I'd like to know why I shouldn't be concerned too.

I want to be able to ensure that calling out to contracts out of my control cannot modify my contract's state in undesirable ways.

But still the **[vultures circle](/r/ethereo/wiki/synereo-rchain-continuation)** because the Synereo/Rchain devs have abandoned their commitments to AMP buyers. As Steve Ballmer said, they designed a ""secure"" operating system and found that no one wanted to buy it. PoW is obsolete and other token issuance schemes ultimately depend on [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) to enforce [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) in order to overcome the [free ~~rider~~ software problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem).

Bitcoin tanked after the Ethereum crowdsale (although I guess a lot of the Ethereum Foundations Bitcoin holdings have recovered now). It is worse when the cryptocurrency is smaller. When you talked about selling with Bitcoin and AMP, I remembered the MaidSafe omniasset:https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/maidsafe-embroiled-safecoin-presale-mastercoin-pump-dump/>Pump: Initially, prior to the presale, Maidsafe had promised to accept Bitcoin at 1:17000, and Mastercoin at 1:3400 in exchange for Maidsafecoin.>**Large Mastercoin holders** who were primed to liquidate their MSC for MSafecoin were able to buy millions of dollars worth of MaidSafeCoin at the promised 0.2 MSC/BTC exchange rate in the first hours of the presale, which prompted David Irvine to close Mastercoin presales in order to äóìleave something for Bitcoinersäó while really leaving nothing for many smaller Bitcoin enthusiasts.  Whom, on the the word of MaidSafe,  bought Mastercoin to buy MaidSafeCoin and whom ended up not even able to buy them.>Shortly after the presale, Maidsafe stopped accepting Mastercoin purchases entirely, and the Mastercoin Exchange rate tanked.>Whatäó»s more, Maidsafe hasnäó»t made any official statement about the change.  Many, many äóìinvestorsäó bought Mastercoin with their Bitcoin in the days prior to the presale in hopes to cash in on the implied 0.2 MSC/BTC exchange rate.  Instead, they arenäó»t even able to make presale purchases even at the vastly diminished exchange rate.This maybe what the **large AMP holders** will end up doing, but instead of using a cap they might be trying to launch this before too many AMP holders know what hit them.

The main use of AMPs in the network is amplifying content. This means that a user can attach some amount of AMPs to their content, which makes it more visible to other users. Every time user receives amplified content, they get a portion of the attached AMPs as a reward.The AMP omnitoken issued on the Bitcoin blockchain represents **an IOU** for the staking currency on Rchain.

5705,Failure,akasha,I'ts Akasha's TestEther as it runs in testnet. It has no value outside of it.
5706,Failure,akasha,"[CONTINUED] We already see this on its public competitor, Steem, which is built with Graphene, derived from BitShares (and, unfortunately has a wealth of issues on its own that reach far beyond just throughput). Graphene was designed with throughput in mind, and even Steem has problems sometimes. I believe its active user base is under 100,000. By comparison, a successful social media platform like Facebook has around 1.5 billion. So that's 100,000 users creating a problem for a blockchain designed to sustain these types of transactions, imagine trying to get it to server 1,500,000,000 users.The way I see it, the complete reliance on Ethereum and IPFS is an altruistic endeavor, but at the moment, it is impractical due to not the limitations of AKASHA's vision, which is noble, but because of the underlying bleed-edge technologies it is trying to leverage. Those technologies are not ready for global scale, so therefore AKASHA will not be either."
5707,Failure,akasha,"Unfortunately, even Ethereum is not in a position to find wide adoption. Sure, in the crypto space it's second to Bitcoin in terms of market cap. But it's not the popularity that matters, it's the technology.The same reason why Ethereum network goes down during popular ICOs, why it takes 10+ minutes to successfully verify a transaction... Those are the same reasons why AKASHA is slow. Right now, AKASHA is in alpha, and it is only on the Ethereum test network. Unless Ethereum does something miraculously about its throughput, then once AKASHA is integrated with the public network, I can only imagine the frustration a user is going to experience trying to simply create an account, let alone post."

By the look of things, we anticipate the beta release somewhere around Q3-Q4.Among other things, the beta release seeks to stress test the entire dapp architecture and its limits in an attempt to see how the infrastructure behaves (Ethereum/Whisper/IPFS/SWARM) with thousands of active users and transactions.With the latest round of smart contracts refactoring, Marius managed to minimize the on-chain footprint even further and we seek to understand from this release how the dapp will fit into the whole Ethereum network in anticipation of the main network launch.https://etherian.world/dapp/akasha/"

This release (0.5.2) covers a major bug affecting non en-us users and a few smaller bug fixes. No shiny new features to show yet, but the wait will be worth it.In the meantime, Marius has started working on the light client side and the initial results are very promising. We will test it thoroughly during the next few days and depending on the tests results we might include it in the next release(s). *insert frogdance .gif emoticon here*We have some exciting things coming also on the design front that will be felt as an overall UI/UX improvement in AKASHA. These enhancements will be implemented *after* the refactoring stage is completed, and hopefully will make things even easier to use. On this note, the much anticipated AKASHA web-version will also come after this refactoring. On the collaboration side, during EDCON Paris I exchanged a few ideas with Vlad, Vitalik, Primavera and others regarding tokens, identity and reputation. It was great, things clicked, and in just a few days weäó»ll continue the brainstorming with Vlad in Bucharest - also called äóìthe little Parisäó.  Weäó»re all really looking forward to Vlad visiting us into our hacklab to continue our conversation - who knows what crazy ideas will take shape from this encounter!We also aim to setup calls and explore integrations in the next week(s) with amazing projects such as the Status, uPort and SWARM. We feel that after these calls we will have a clearer idea on how we can collaborate and do great things together.  After all, the äóìEthereum wayäó is about **synergy** , and intuitively I think we all feel that there is *synergy* between our projects - itäó»s a matter of figuring out *where* and *how* to collaborate rather than *if*.Aside from these highlights, we feel that the next weeks will be all about hard work that will come with hidden rewards in the form of a more modular dapp architecture and optimization in various stack layers that will solidify later into a stable foundation for AKASHA 1.0In the end Iäó»d like to thank everyone for testing AKASHA in such an early state and for the positive energy youäó»re sending our way through your support as a Community! If you have any questions about this release or AKASHA in general, Iäó»m more than happy to answer them!"

5735,Failure,akasha,"> It's basically like torrent right?Yes, except it's like one single big interplanetary sized torrent swarm, instead of lots of smaller ones. Based on ~~merkle trees~~ *IPLD* etc.> Is that safe for personal info?Unsure, I havn't seen the akasha implmentation myself. But IPFS is just a protocol/file system. Encryption can be implemented on top. I would assume privacy would be one of main goals for a distributed social media replacement. Akasha isn't even fully released yet, there may be security bugs like any project this young. I wouldn't recommend storing any sensitive information on akasha quite yet.> And can the Akasha network scale easily with IPFS with Facebook content in mind?Yes, see filecoin. There will be insentives for miners to supply lots of file storage and network speeds. With the additional advantange of the content being distributed locally, with offline support etc. If you take a look at bitcoin hash rate as a comparison, you would expect raw performance to scale beyond traditional CDNs and with lower latency. For example, download the file directly from your roommate on the same local network! or the CDN that your neighbour down the street is running on their fiber connection, or maybe your ISP is running.Regardless, distributed technologies scale better with more nodes, especially if you are on the edge of the network, like in a rural environment.https://youtu.be/cU-n_m-snxQ?t=1272> Will it be fast enough?Yes, when filecoin is up and running. But for now there are no insentives to seed content.And I'm not sure what akasha is using for their database & identity etc. Probably something ethereum based. Maybe take a look at steem.it (different blockchain) & orbit chat.I'm sure performance will be acceptable, we'll see some real numbers soon enough. Just keep in mind that the project is still in alpha and p2p networks scale better with more nodes. So the worst performance will most likely be experienced during the alpha, and scale upwards from then on out."
