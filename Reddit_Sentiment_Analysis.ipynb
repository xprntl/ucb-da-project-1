If you ever loose the keys, your $100M dollars of Bitcoin is irretrievably lost. If your machine ever crashes and and rats eat your paper wallet, you have an encrypted copy of the key on the cloud you can download anywhere in the world, and completely reconstruct your wallet, on any machine.

A wallet is a window viewer onto the blockchain to allow you to see your particular transaction history on the chain. The heart of your wallet is a public key (which you can show to anyone so they can send you money) and a private key (which you should never reveal, not even to you cat). The public key is passive: it allows things to BE sent; the private key is active: it allows you to send. (With the public key, you can be utterly promiscuous; with the private key, you must take a vow of chastity). These keys are simply long strings of alpha-numbers that can not be guessed, except possibly by your cat. The only thing stored in your wallet are your private and public keys, nothing else, not even money or tokens. The balances and transaction history are  simply read off the blockchain at any moment and displayed. The blockchain is the account of record, not your wallet.\n",

If I owned Tezos and found out that the management team are using the token purchaser's money to simply buy stocks, bonds, and precious metals I would sell my Tezos. I already own stocks, and prefer to pick them myself. The bond market is in the biggest bubble in history. Gold has been flat for years. The management team came from the world of high finance, and they are obviously grasping at straws with respect to what to do with all the money. It's destined to fail if true leadership and a true plan fail to emerge. At the very least management should be avoiding stocks and bonds. Cash and gold are stable, but stocks and bonds are not what token purchasers anticipated the team would purchase with the money raised.\n",

You'll get a lot of hexadecimal garbage with pieces of strings in between. Once you locate a string that looks like the Tezos file, look in the hexa garbage around and you should find your mnemonics. If you are out of luck the mnemonics won't be all on the same page and the next page may be located at a completely different place.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you could find any string with the raw search that looks like it belonged to the pdf file but couldn't locate all or any of the mnemonics, you need to extract all the strings from the raw volume and then filter the list by looking up each string in the BIP39 dictionary file. This is labour intensive so a script will be needed.\n",

      "If the first file system level steps don't work and you need to work on the raw volume, I would recommend using Linux as it comes with all the needed tools by default and is easy to script. You can download a live cd distribution and install it on a usb drive, then boot from that drive and mount your main drive as read only. If you are not familiar with Linux or what I'm describing sounds unfamiliar to you, find someone you can trust and who is proficient with Linux and ask him to help with doing the above.\n",

      "Most importantly, until you can clone your drive or find someone to help you do it stop using your PC. Any further action you do could be overwriting the location where your mnemonics are stored on the disk. Just shut down the PC completely.\n",

      "I'm not making a general statement about ICOs that come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. My statement is specifically targeted at the Filecoin ICO that was designed in complete disregard of basic game theory principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main functions of ICOs is to anchor the price by creating a schelling point under which all ICO participants will consider that the price is \"too low\" and will refuse to sell hereby creating a very strong price floor. An ICO designed that way ensures that investors who bought at or under the schelling point will almost automatically make a positive return if the market maintains its initial hype. There are many strategies to create such a point. The most obvious one is to sell all tokens at the same price: this creates a rock solid, near unbreakable floor. Another strategy that incentivizes a bit more risk taking is to give a small bonus to earlier investors, large enough to encourage early commitment, but small enough to prevent the creation of two perceived price anchors. It's common to see 5~25% bonus given to all investors who come within a long enough time window to make sure that everyone who was actively looking to invest can get in. Long enough windows ensure that later comers are people who **genuinely** heared of the project later or are **genuinely** influenced by earlier comers. Later comers in such circumstances usually won't object to being considered \"late comers\" and invest at a slightly higher price. Early birds will also consider the discount a natural compensation for the risk they took, so that the entire cohort of investors early and late alike will likely adopt the final price tranche of the ICO as a schelling point hereby ensuring that all investors will see a positive return.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few example of high profile ICOs that succesfully implemented this strategy of a progressive, reasonable, fair and natural incentivization of early commitment are Ethereum or Tezos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what's important to understand is that Filecoin completely messed up their pricing function by creating inconsistent incentives effectively creating a series of weak price anchors with a complete lack of widespread consensus among investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first huge mistake of this ICO was to exclude all non-accredited investors, even the non-US ones who were excluded for no good reason at all since no financial regulation actually mandates their exclusion. This reduced the pool of investors involved in the price discovery process to a few thousands at most, as compared to the legion of tens of thousands of investors this ICO could have attracted had the founders not been over-zealous in minimizing their legal exposure. The result is that not many of the people who will ultimately be trading FIL followed the ICO and have a well informed opinion of what would be a fair price for FIL based on what investors paid. Due to this, whatever price anchors are found by the ICO process are weak at best since they can and will be entirely ignored by the market that is mostly unaware of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second very bad idea was to allow only their cronies to invest in the presale (making early supporters feel left out), run the presale only two weeks before the ICO (therefore at no significantly higher risk), give the presale a massive and completely unjustified 40~50% discount as compared to the starting ICO price and allow cronies to invest as much as $55M for as much as 55% of the entire tokens available. This effectively set the de-facto fair price and hard price floor of the FIL token at $0.75, and created a strong feeling that any subsequent price levels are completely unjustified and illegitimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third **absolutely retarded idea** (which was partially dumped eventually, albeit extremely reluctantly) was to make the price of the ICO increase linearly with every dollar invested to up to 4x the starting price of the ICO. The reason that this is (sorry to insist) **deeply retarded** to anyone with even the slightest understanding of game theory and price formation theory is that **it prevents the creation of a schelling point**. When not a single investor pays the same price, how can the market converge to any estimation of what would be a fair price? This would have prevented the creation of a second price anchor, and reinforced $0.75 as the one and only valid price anchor. This would also have discouraged most investors from investing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to widespread investors outrage, founders backed off, and settled for a slightly less damaging, but still amazingly stupid solution that consisted on averaging all investments in the first hour. This resulted in the investment of $145M at $2.63 hereby creating a second price anchor at $2.63 and making the third stage start at an outrageous $4.95! \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the retarded princing mechanics that was supposed to apply to the entire ICO is being applied to the third stage: the price is increasing linearly from $4.95 to $6. No price anchor will be created in that range due to the linear distribution of investments and the small amount of tokens sold in that phase. That means that the system is going to be structured on two points of equilibrium: $2.63 supported by a monetary mass of 55M token (28% of the total supply) and $0.7 supported by a monetary mass of 110M token (56% of the total supply). The higher price floor will hold only so long as presale investors refrain from selling at or under $2.63 which is far from being guaranteed given that $2.63 is an immediate 250% risk free profit. Eventually, if FIL fails to undergo a significant price appreciation, more and more presale investors and ICO investors alike may be temptated to recoup some of their investment, at costing price for ICO investors and at a 250% profit for presale investors. This could lead to the breach of the price floor, amplified by the panic of ICO investors seeing the price dropping under their investment price with no clear support until $0.75.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that the ICO price is now at $5+ nearly 100% above the higher price anchor and supported by a tiny little divided minority that hasn't even paid the same price, there is a very strong case to be made that the price of $5+ per coin won't be sustainable and that the market will quickly revert to what is perceived as an already very unfair but still somewhat popularly supported level of $2.63+.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't ask me how the founders of a project that is heavily reliant on game theory could show themselves this ignorant of even the most elementary notion of game theory and price formation theory. This puzzles me a great deal and makes me wonder if Filecoin will be economically viable. \n",
      "\n",
      "tl;dr: don't buy at $5. The way the ICO was designed has set the higest stable price point $2.63 and the hard price floor at $0.75. Given that $5+ is a 566% immediate profit for presale investors who bought at $0.75 and 100% immediate profit for most ICO investors who bought at $2.63, this creates a significant incentive for investors to sell all the while expecting that their peers will also sell. In a classic case of tragedy of the commons, this will most likely lead to a significant pullback toward $2.63 that is the highest solid equilibrium point for the FIL market.\n",

Clearly there isn't a demand for a de-centralized version of Dropbox/Drive based on the utilization of the Sia and Storj networks. Furthermore, if there is only a single point of access to those files, how is that any better than a centralized solution? It is needlessly difficult to share files on Storj (maybe that is part of the design) and it would be a nightmare to use Storj as a de-centralized backend the way you potentially can with IPFS, once Filecoin is built to incentivize pinning files. AFAIK you can't even share files with Sia yet. \n",

      "$30 per FIL in year 4 implies a $30bn valuation which is approx. $2bn more than Ethereum is currently worth.  IMO $30 in year 4 would be not a very good outcome.  That is the problem with this sort of valuation at ICO - no offense, but if you think 10x for 5 years in the crypto space is worth the risk, you need to learn more about the space.  There are some little known cryptos called BTC and ETH that probably have a much higher probability of hitting that return over the same time period, plus they are proven, liquid, etc.  An attractive price for FIL is $100 if the ICO price is $2+...  The only snag with that is that it implies a $100,000,000,000 market cap in year 4.  Not out of the question but it is just shy of the total market cap of the entire crypto market at this point.\n",

Hard question with lots of implications in many directions. At the moment, I think a right way for FF or PL to support mining would be supporting more independent groups. IDK, maybe investing in them? or giving incentives/support? Either way, I hope to and think we will see lots of independent miners joining the network.

I think this is very straight forward. As it is, we only want investors/buyers who can trust us. That does not mean we are not accountable to all the work we need to do, and accountable to making Filecoin a wildly successful network, but at the same time, placing restriction on the funding is not what we are going to do. There are strong reasons I started Protocol Labs and did not try building IPFS in academia, or at another company. We are working for the long term, if you don't think our intentions and values are true to that, then just don't invest in us. It's really that straightforward to us. We may be asking a lot. We may lose a lot of potential investors/buyers that way. And that's totally fine with us. I would much rather have way less funds and very long-term aligned investors, than lots of money from short-term investors. I've said this elsewhere, we really want people that know us, that understand us, that know our values, and want success for both the Filecoin Network and Protocol Labs.\n",

      "I do not fault the team for wanting to reward their \"Advisers\" but it is unfortunate that it is at the expense of the Investors. I think they rationalize it since it's \"accredited investors.\" What is messed up is the linear vesting. The fact that Advisers could start selling tokens just as quickly as investors can is the true issue (regardless if they could sell less of their allocation because their amount will be up at least 4x). If Filecoin raises $200m for an average price of $3 then the float at launch is $200m for the investors and $3/.75 = 4x.... 4 x $52m = 208m for the Advisers float. Assuming everyone chooses the shortest vesting periods which is consistent for Advisers and Investors. Advisers that sell coupled with miners selling may very well make this ICO trade at a lower price than the Investors paid for. The Investors are taking on the same risk as the Advisers and lose out on opportunity cost of holding btc or ether. My beef is this is rewarding Advisers far too much and really providing a risky scenario for investors. We have shifted back towards the way our current society works (the individual investor getting shafted while the institution makes several multiples). Filecoin just is not appreciative of the future users at all. Great Technologists and I do not believe they are bad guys but this does not reflect the Blockchain Culture. I am not upset that Investors are not guaranteed 3x... people have been delusional and feel entitled to 2-5x returns on everything. I am upset that they are putting Investors that are investing at the same time period as the \"Advisers\" at a material probability of being underwater even if Filecoin delivers.\n",

      "**Sale Mechanics** – I have shared thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/filecoin/comments/6sc7v7/poll_what_multiplier_do_you_think_insiders_are/dlcd161/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/filecoin/comments/6s87ml/creating_a_win_win_solution/) regarding the current sale mechanics and significant shortcomings that I see.  To address the notion that the current model lets the market set the price - I believe that the price was largely set when 45% of the FIL available in the crowdsale was sold to advisors at an average price of $0.57 per FIL.  Deviating dramatically from that price (beyond a low multiple) appears to create significant discrepancies in the economic interests of parties involved.  Furthermore, how is the market supposed to set the price when market participants have no idea what price they are paying for FIL?  Please consider this from an investor perspective – we are being asked to invest with no knowledge of the price (beyond a six dollar range).  I understand from your perspective the price may not be a huge deal – even at the $6.83 end of the range, you expect significant appreciation if the vision is realized.  It feels incredibly unfair to have to blindly choose to participate at potentially a 9-10x multiple of people who invested two weeks ago.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Please consider a transparent, fixed price for a finite period of time.  I think that the right number is somewhere between $1.00 and $1.30 but understand if you think it is higher.  Even if the price is higher but visible, it is a much more equitable proposition to participate or not.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You have a tremendous tool in coinlist that you may be overlooking: unique registration for each participant (versus crypto wallet registration in other ICO’s which can easily be gamed).  To avoid creating race conditions, you could give everyone registered on coinlist an equal allocation of the available coins for the first hour.  At an opening price of $1.30 with max discounts, this results in approximately a $114,000,000 cap for the remaining coins.  I have no idea how many people are registered to participate but a $100,000 allocation per person would suffice for 1,140 participants, $50,000 pp = 2,280 participants, $25,000 pp = 4,560 participants, etc.  If the allocation is extremely low, you can give people another round or two to get a fair bite at the apple.  If everyone has had an opportunity to buy $50-100k worth (or whatever number makes sense given the number of participants that you estimate) for the first hour or other period of time, then go off to the races with the pricing function – at that time people can actually buy based on their appetite (e.g. if someone wants to accumulate a $1m position with only $114M total available, it should come at a price).  This also achieves a goal that I think has been missing from the current sale – I believe that you generally want to encourage as wide of participation as possible. This type of structure would be much more fair than the current structure.\n",

      "The advisor sale involved an amazing group of technologists, researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, industry leaders, and investors. All of these people and organizations: either (a) have been working hard with us for years to make IPFS and Filecoin successful, (b) have fully committed themselves to work hard with us and for the Filecoin Network for many years to come, and/or (c) offer tremendously valuable advice, hands-on help, knowledge, skills, resources, connections, and more. We have already worked with most of the people and firms involved — most of them for the last 3 years, as advisors or investors to Protocol Labs, to IPFS, and to our team. We welcomed many NEW people and firms that showed significant promise and who have made very strong commitments for the long term. We managed to get some partners pivotal to anybody in the cloud storage industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will put all our advisors to work for the Filecoin Network. And I am not kidding when I say that the group we assembled in our advisor sale is likely to be one of the most capable group that have ever funded any project. (I say this with full understanding of the breath of projects and the magnitude of support many tech projects have gotten.) And all of our advisors are committed -- vested -- to work closely with us to make the Filecoin Network as valuable as they can, for years to come.\n",

      "First, it is NOT projected to be sold for 10-12x. If we raise 100M the average price is $1.86-$2.32, and then it's 2.5x-4.4x. If we raise 200M the average price is $2.50-$3.16, and then it's 3x-6x. yes, it goes up from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not understand why so many people here simultaneously think that (a) this sale is not a good deal, and that (b) it will sell out. One of those should give, no? How can those two positions be held simultaneously so firmly? If you don't agree it is a good deal, then do not invest, at all, please. If you are right, then many others will agree and also not invest. We would raise less, we would not sell out. If you do invest, then you negate that position to some degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest issue here is that with the average structure, people can be pulled up by a lot of capital coming in all at the same time. This can be frustrating, and exacerbates the difference from advisor sale to public sale... it's unfortunate, we are thinking about it. It would feel much, much less disparate without averages, and some people getting the lowest price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second thing to say is that lots of the people in the advisor sale have already contributed a tremendous amount, more than the median investor coming into the public sale will likely contribute (beyond money). I think most people on r/filecoin are severely discounting the work of people who have helped us bring Filecoin into being, for years. And, to be direct and honest, it is likely the case that the median old and the median new people in the advisor sale will likely add more value through their direct hands on work than the median public sale investor (it's likely that the median public sale investors will be passive speculators -- maybe not the people here in r/filecoin, but definitely likely for the whole sale). I'm not trying to sell anyone short here, I know that tons of people coming into this public sale will be amazingly valuable contributors to the network. Of course, we expect many people in the public sale to contribute much, much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it helps, for the first hour, plan is to show in the UX what the average price is so far (paid txns, w/o in-flight txns), so some can choose to wait and see for a few minutes, and decide not to invest if the avg price goes too high. The commited investors likely want to invest as early as they can (to try to price out others), but participants preferring the option to opt out could wait to see how much accumulates before investing.\n",

      "Also, people are saying \"this is not a good way to distribute the token\", well please remember that we DO NOT intend the investor sale to be \"the way to distribute FIL\". Our main distribution will come from mining! ETH prioritized miners much less (for good reason, it's going to be a PoStake network). For Filecoin, miners and clients are the main people in the network. Distribution through mining. We are very confident we'll have a nice distribution, by year 2, miners overtake investors, and overtake PL+FF. By year 4, miners overtake investors+PL+FF. See See: https://protocol.github.io/filecoin-econ-graphs -- Maybe don't invest-- maybe go for HDDs instead. Or nothing at all.

For example, we will continue funding IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, and other underlying technologies, all of which are absolutely KEY to Filecoin. There's a whole stack here. More, we have to fund some cryptography and systems work (we need more good libraries, some new ones). Separately, we may invest significantly into the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, as we will be using lots of that tech (and we need to improve some of it). For example, we'd really like formally verified contracts (there's great recent work on this, but implementations not yet there). We need to have the freedom to invest in these and other ancilliary projects that are valuable to Filecoin. Also, worth noting that Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment lab -- much of the work that will benefit Filecoin for years to come may come out of seemingly unrelated work. Note also that Protocol Labs' reward is to be able to do and fund more, different work.\n",

I think this is very straight forward. As it is, we only want investors/buyers who can trust us. That does not mean we are not accountable to all the work we need to do, and accountable to making Filecoin a wildly successful network, but at the same time, placing restriction on the funding is not what we are going to do. There are strong reasons I started Protocol Labs and did not try building IPFS in academia, or at another company. We are working for the long term, if you don't think our intentions and values are true to that, then just don't invest in us. It's really that straightforward to us. We may be asking a lot. We may lose a lot of potential investors/buyers that way. And that's totally fine with us. I would much rather have way less funds and very long-term aligned investors, than lots of money from short-term investors.

This is a cakewalk in comparison. On the other side of an IPO, companies find themselves answerable to the market every quarter. Given the valuation you're seeking and the amount of dollars you will raise, you should expect even more scrutiny from a bigger public on an ongoing basis, expecting you to deliver on a several billion dollar valuation for a project in a space that may not work at all and has no revenue nor proven source of value creation.

      "1/ Right now on S3 the cost of storing data is $23/TB/month, but that includes backups and guarantees that the data won't be lost. Assuming that Filecoin is able to undercut that price slightly, let's say $21/TB/month, it would require that the data is copied onto 3 separate hard drives to have any guarantee that the data wouldn't be lost. So the mining cost of $21 would be split between the three miners that are simultaneously storing the data. This would give each miner revenue of $7/month for renting out their TB of data. Right now the cost of a 1TB hard drive is around $100, so the miner wouldn't be able to even make a return on their hardware for more than a year. That plus the computational cost of calculating the Proof of SpaceTime.

      "Mr. Zurrer - I respect and appreciate what you do and what you guys have been able to achieve.  I do not share the sentiment with the OP and think this discourse is a bit unfair, however I do see the roots of this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "While I agree with you that many (if not all) projects have special allocations, discounts and even free tokens for advisors (and early contributors), almost all that I've seen create different allocations for advisors and for the general token sale.  **By mixing the two in a common pool, it creates the perception of a zero-sum game where advisors are benefiting at the expense of the general investors.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "Most advisor allocations that I see are typically a much smaller fraction of the general sale allocation - sometimes 1:9, 1:5 or on the extreme 1:3 (for every one token sold or given to advisors, three are sold to the general public).  In this case the ratio is very close to 1:1 (9:11 to be exact).  This appears to be way out of line with other ICOs.  Based on data that Protocol Labs released in the last two days, the average price of this sale was $0.57 per FIL.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As investors, we see that nearly half of the ICO allocation was sold to \"advisors\" at price of $0.57 per FIL.  **We are then told that we will have to invest with zero visibility on the price, that it will be somewhere between $1.30 and $6.83 but we will not know until after we've handed over our money.**  This is the source of much of the frustration.  It creates an automatic 4-9x return for the advisors, who just put their money in within the last couple of weeks (hard to argue that this capital has faced risk commensurate with this return, especially given the discount and transparency on price).  It also creates perverse economic incentives where nearly half the ICO participants have a cost basis of around $0.57 while half will likely have a basis in excess of $2.00 - 4.00.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While I understand that the advisors are all \"long term stake holders\" and achieved $0.57 by generally vesting for 3 years, we know that this was not a \"friends and family\" round.  Nearly every sophisticated crypto investment group and many big SV players participated.  There appears to be a huge gap in the alignment of interests between the advisors and general participants in the current model.  Taking into account the vesting time frame for the advisors, what is stopping some advisors (which include some of the savviest investors and traders in the crypto space) from selling at the first sign of adversity / bearishness post-launch in an attempt to influence the price and increase their holdings at a lower price, perhaps at the expense of the general crowdsale participants?  While this may sound outlandish, this type of shenanigans is not unheard of, especially when all parties are acting in their economic best interest.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that this is the root of much angst surrounding this crowdsale.  You do not need to answer this, and this is largely a rhetorical question but: would Polychain participate in the general crowdsale given these conditions, with very little visibility on the price of your investment?  If you invested $1,000,000, you could end up with somewhere between 769k FIL and 147k FIL (no discounts included) but you wouldn’t know until after you invested (compared to the same investment yielding 1,754K FIL in the advisor sale with the discount).\n",

      "This ico is a mess, there is no way to solve the conundrum that 55% of the tokens  has to fund  100% of the operation.  That was the reason for the lunatic scheme of dynamic pricing, if 55% has to fund 100% you need to make the token price unknown, there is no way around that. If you make it public before the investors chip in, then, the moment it gets 3x relative to the Listers, no one is going to buy, so, it doesn't really matter whatever the scheme you come up with, you have to make that price invisible to the investors. I really hope I’m mistaken but I see no way that they come up with a flat rate in the first hour as it is suggested on another post, because the problem is then shifted to the next trench, someone has to put the money, and if the funding is displaced to the later stages of the sale,  when it is already evident the price is  6x, no more money is going to come in. There is no way already rich inverstors are going to pay 6x in any ICO, no matter how promising and interesting it is to 45% of Listers. You could have reserved only 10% of the mass for your Listers and get them their risk free 10x, but they got too greedy and sucked up 45% there is no way they get 10x on 55% of the mass. \n",

Since none in Protocol Labs is brave enough to go against The List, maybe you could  return 90% of the money and dilute accordingly among all the Listers, tell them the suckers are revolting and  their 10x is not guaranteed.\n",

      "Don't forget we only knew about the \"Advisor Sale\" because Cedric Dahl made a YouTube video. I don't think they were going to tell the Public Investor community. There was absolutely no mention of the Advisor Sale on 07/25/17 when the FIL sale was announced. Even when the 07/27/17 sale was postponed, they could have easily mentioned this but did not. Cedric forced their hands with the video. So, now that this has been postponed to 08/10/17, how are we supposed to trust that another token sale is not taking place right now (as I type the comment)? A scenario in which another sale is afforded to those connected who don't like the average-price scheme recently announced. Like r_crypto above, I painstakingly converted cryptocurrencies to fiat and wired the money from my bank account to Angel List account. How can those like me think this new averaging-scheme is fair - given we followed the announced rule? The more frightening thing here is that the avg-scheme or second postponement isn’t the issue of most concern. Let’s not forget the potential valuation of IPFS even using the most conservative of numbers or the huge difference in price for some so-called “Advisors” and Public Investors for taking the same risk - if even not more risk by the former group.

      "4: raking in say, 500 USD million is obscene and not required. FileCoin if it is any good should mostly self funding. Many cryptos are given away to achieve buy-in. Stellar gave away 16 Billion as I recall... and they have real software, and understand the SEC risks.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "6: Lastly, and unlike Bitcoin, running a FileCoin node is going to be just for the large data centers.

Let us say you made this deal to Sam Altman (one of the advisors who was offered a pre-deal) in that you offered him FCs for some amount of money but you tell him that the terms he is getting may or may not be sweeter than what the general public gets. Further, right at the last moment, after he had funded his Angelist account, you tell him, hey Sam, btw, the deal which we gave you last week has completely changed. Here is the new deal where you now don't even know how many FCs you are going to get (except there is an upper bound) and you have 14hrs to figure out what to do. How do you think he will feel?\n",

I knew that if I used fiat, I would be able to buy at or very near the displayed FIL price before closing out the order.  This allowed me to manage my risk in an ICO where the price could skyrocket into obscene valuations.  Even at $1, filecoin is valuing itself at $2 billion.

      "> \n",
      "> Storj, as an open-source project, is de-centralized in theory, but pretty centralized in its current implementation. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/storj/comments/6dffhw/statement_regarding_storj_and_decentralization/dj5ptmj/) is a good read from the thread. To add to that comment, there are other key factors that make Storj more \"centralized\" than something like IPFS and it essentially boils down to the economics: the storage/bandwidth pricing for users is set by Storj Labs (the company), the payout formula/rate to Storj nodes is also set by Storj Labs [as shown here](https://gist.github.com/super3/a36a3d4967951ec678200f499364b81a), and it also looks like Storj Labs handles all of the monthly payouts internally. In contrast, the plan for Filecoin/IPFS is to create separate marketplaces for storage and retrieval, essentially letting the free market decide the best rate and directly connecting consumers to providers through smart contracts. To be fair, Storj has an active team and announced intentions to integrate smart contracts and micropayments (real-time payments instead of monthly) into the platform, which would help address some of the above points, so it will be interesting to see how these products evolve over the next year.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Bancor is not an exchange. It is a protocol which allows for asynchronous price discovery and continuous liquidity. This means that converting a smart token does not require matching two parties in real time with opposite wants, rather, it can be completed by a single party directly through the token’s smart contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, unlike exchanges where you have to find someone who actively wants to buy what you’re selling, smart tokens are always completely and immediately liquid regardless of trade volume. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) There are no similar currencies at the moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) There are four use cases. Token Shares, which are continuously liquid tokens. Token baskets, which connect non-smart-tokens to the bancor network and thereby give them full liquidity. Token baskets, which hold multiple currencies in their reserves at different percentages of total value, allowing you to invest in multiple assets at chosen percentages (like an ETF). And token networks, which connect other smart tokens together (BNT itself is the main token network token).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Problems Solved: The double coincidence of wants problem in asset exchange. That is, the problem of finding someone who wants what you have to sell and has what you want to buy, in real-time.\n",
      "The invention of money was the solution to this problem in barter. The invention of Bancor is the solution to this problem in asset exchange.\n",

      "\n",
      "So if, when Alice creates the XYZ/BNT token changer, she also purchases a bunch of that token changer's smart tokens, she would see their value grow by x% with every transaction the token changer processes. The fee wouldn't go to her directly, but she would be able to 'access' it by liquidating her token changer smart tokens for a higher price than she bought them for (the price having risen because of the reserves having grown as a result of the fees being added to them).\n",
      "\n",
      "The key thing to understand here is that a token changer works both as a mini exchange (that exchanges XYZ for BNT) and as a token itself (so you can hold XYZBNT tokens that get their value from the XYZ & BNT in the token changer's reserves).\n",

The way the Bancor price discovery formula works is when you purchase from the smart contract, you would deposit ETH/BNT and that would be added to the reserve of your token and then the smart contract would then create and issue you your token.  This increases the supply of your token but also increases the price/ value of your token.  I suggest reading the Bprotocal white paper for better clarification.

I saw a nice Arbitrage opportunity today on an exchange and watched how the price Discovery mechanism and exchange found parity. The interesting part was how it slowed down the crazy Market. Now I realize that some may find this as a flaw in the smart contract, but as I participated directly, the experience of seeing the stable liquidity of the smart contract ground a crazy Market was really powerful. It reminded me of an IPO where the underwriter has an overhang that they can allocate to stabilize a new offering. I saw this during the Facebook IPO and there was basically a guarantee that the price would not fall below a certain amount because the underwriter acted as a market maker to ensure a price floor.  In that case, just like like the bancor price floor it lasted a short while and then the price dropped.  The price Discovery will also slow things down in a crazy Market provided the reserves don't get consumed.  I'm starting to get it, but need to see more demand before getting too excited!\n",

If the CEO of a public company ignores the share price, he will find himself out of a job very quickly.

The only ways in which they have control over the price (the tokens they own) are already known variables (the roadmap for how the tokens will be spent, the tokens that are time-locked, etc.). They may be able to manipulate the market with announcements/media, but I don't see this as a positive for long-term success or credibility.

It isn't their stock, it's a component of their product. It just seems strange to me to feel like they should have anything much to say about its price - the focus (and speculation) should be on the product (which will drive the price). I'd certainly like to see things moving faster, just as much for what it means for the token price and to actually USE the product (TOKEN CHANGERS!), but it sounds like many of the holdups at this point are regulatory/legal, and if slower means fewer legal and regulatory problems in the future I think that's good for everyone.\n",

The value hasn't continued to drop because people mostly stopped selling or there are enough people that believe this is a good price to create equilibrium with those that are selling. Likewise, the price isn't going to spike because of a small fraction of the market trading at higher prices, it will take more money flowing in over time to dramatically raise it, which will likely only happen as the platform is developed and used.

It's also not Bancor's responsibility to push/market Stoxx.

They also indicated they've got a growing queue of people working on other ICOs for various tokens using the Bancor system, Stoxx just happened to be the first one ready (the delays in the others are probably delays caused by the teams launching them, as they develop proof of concept demos, tweak whitepapers, develop marketing materials, recruit team members and advisors, etc., but that's just my guess).

They will seamlessly be able to integrate with the underlying blockchain system and facilitate the creation of many different apps using prediction markets for different purposes. I’m sure the prediction data will be sold as well on the back end to researchers and other big data companies. Looking past the cringe inducing IG post (hopefully Mayweather gets knocked out for it) and their shady past, Stox could wind up being one of the big ICO winners of 2017.\n",

      "Yes when I bought ICNX, ETH was about 200$ because I remember that my iconomi profile was showing cca 1000$ value (I sent 5 ETH there). I think what is confusing me is that while only ETH on its own got 2x gains since, the value of the whole tracker went up 2x as well. If had split my investment between BTC, ETH and XMR I would have made 7x. And that is the confusing part - if I invested in stocks individually picked, I would never make as much as investing into a tracker unless  I made some really really lucky picks. Here we are talking about 3 from the top 10 crypto... Like if I invested in Google, FB and Amazon.  I'm just getting a feeling that it is a bit early days of this stuff in crypto as it is very unlikely that one of these assets will go down on it's own - it will either completely burts or all of it will go up. But we have to start somewhere and it will be interesting to see where will this go. Either way buying BTC, ETH and XMR on my own would net me 3.5x higher return. Again, correct me if I'm wrong.  \n",

I am not suggesting that iconomi money would completely inflate or deflate a coin, but I do think that in reasonable sums of money are coming into the fund this would provide people with further confidence to invest in the coin/crypto they were thinking about adding into their fund. With a reasonably updated Indicator of money flowing into the blx fund (doesn't have to be daily). Perhaps in the future a 2x icn holding on the iconomi site would give you all data for the various daa's and again money flow into each particular cryptocurrency.

Buyback orders will always be below the highest bid and will not surpass 20% of the trading volume in the last 24 hours.

If you do not like the way they communicate, you need to hit a decision. In my personal opinion, I will just hold and have patience as I firmly believe in the team. If you have lost your faith there is only one thing you can do, because I think the team is too busy with actual working stuff than answering people like you with zero patience. And besides that, having a working platform that generates revenue for ICN holders and brings new money in is awesome. I'll gladly have patience if they keep delivering.

      "One of  the reasons bitconnect is still around and is doing so well still where so many others like them have failed is that they have various interconnected systems which incentivize someone to keep their money WITHIN bitconnect. For example if you enter bitconnect you're forced to lock in your investment, the genius part is that those which do that will want to reinvest locking each time they do those deposits themselves into another set period of time. Their coin is also both required to buy in order to make a \"loan\" but it also provides a way for people  voluntarily buy it as a way to increase the value of  their interest before they reinvest it.  In order words  they aren't forced to reinvest and keep their store of value within their system but those invest the most will also be those who want to benefit most, and compound the interest rather than simply remove it, so they make you feel like it's your choice not to freeing of needing to actually pay out.  Very clever.  It's much like a bank, so long as everyone doesn't decide to take their money out at the same time it's ok. The difference is bitconnect don't even claim you can take out your cash whenever you want. \n",

I am still not assuming any ill intention by the team - other than a sloppy attitude - but the underlying moral hazard is unfair nonetheless, as it leaves ICN token holders to their own devices while ICO funds keep on footing the bill for something those same token holders could possibly not profit from.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more time passes the greater the chances for such an unfavorable scenario become (I am gathering together my previous comments here):\n",
      "\n",
      "1.   However one looks at it, the buyback announcement has been an alarming red flag, given that the dividend issue was something easily foreseeable since the very outset of the ICONOMI project. The later turnaround towards buybacks because of dividends impracticability - technically a false claim - made the team look amateurish in their approach to investors and short-sighted in their ability to properly plan corporate business stuff, to say the least. Actually, buybacks serve the only purpose of putting as much space as possible between ICN tokens and a full-feathered security, while bringing a lot of debatable side effects as a consequence - most of which have already been analyzed in depth elsewhere. The suspect raised by many people that the team intentionally promoted dividends as a fast selling hook capable of locking up as much starting capital as possible during the ICO appears quite grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.   It seems to me that ICONOMI team used/uses legal concepts like *shareholding* and *ownership* as interchangeable, while they are definitely not. During the ICO stage (and later on) the team repeatedly referenced ICN token holders as *shareholders* with proper shareholding status (including voting rights). The white paper - which has been further modified after the ICO ended - states that ”ICN tokens represent ownership of the ICONOMI platform, allowing their holders to receive dividends and vote on ICONOMI related issues”. Not sure whether this was an intentionally deceptive misrepresentation - I am assuming they hired a law firm before issuing their ICO - but it’s quite disturbing. Shareholding and co-ownership carry pretty different legal implications, both in scope and in applicable law principles. Also, dividends are paid by companies, not by co-owned services. Still, many people swear they are ICONOMI shareholders because the team said so (as a side note, to date there isn’t still any evidence that an actual entity exists for the ICONOMI project - let alone an entity whose shareholding/stakeholding is made up exclusively by ICN token holders according to clear and legally binding terms).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.   Speaking of those “related issues” mentioned in the white paper, I can think of at least two occasions when such issues have clearly arisen: dividends turned into buybacks and Cofound.it strip-off. Those were financially and strategically meaningful events for every ICN token holder, capable of significantly affect token value, yet no vote ever took place on those matters. Makes me wonder what a “related issue” is according to the ICONOMI team and how exactly a token holder is supposed to vote on such issues. This kind of unbalanced and asymmetrical power in the hands of the team is concerning, regardless of whether or not ICN tokens represent shareholding or co-ownership. Token holders are completely defenseless against unfavorable initiatives carried out by the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.   The main argument used to confute any ill-intentioned scenario - the team has skin in the game (13M tokens) hence they have no incentive to bring the project to failure - is weak and overstated. Contrary to conventional crypto coins and tokens, ICN tokens don’t bear any using value independent from their issuing entity. The ICONOMI team here is the only part owning the actual value in their business model (opposed to, for example, Bitcoin Core or Ethereum Foundation, where the network's value is the real deal, it can outlive its founders and those same founders have no incentive to walk away). If the teams walks away then ICN token value plunges to zero. At current ICN market price we're talking approx. 5M USD worth-of tokens, on top of 10M USD funds already collected during the ICO. If ICONOMI team spots a way to *autonomously* earn multiples of that figure (there are many ways they could capitalize on their brand, market position and know-how) then 5M USD in missed capital gains represents an insignificant ticket price for such an outcome. Messing up the whole project becomes an economically efficient strategy, and it doesn’t even need to be carried out in a destructive or blatantly upfront manner. Hypothetically, claiming token *impracticability* because of any of those aforementioned loose ends in the project (either legal or technical) or even endlessly delaying the release of valuable platform features will suffice for the team to let ICN tokens quietly sink into oblivion while saving their faces with plausible arguments.\n",

If ICONOMI team figures out a way to earn, say, 10x that money (and if you think there are many ways they could capitalize on their brand and market position) then 6M USD in missed capital gains represents an insignificant ticket price for such an outcome. Messing up the whole project becomes an economically efficient strategy, and an ICN token holder stands on a tricky territory on a legal basis to object to such a move.

Holding ICN with this set up (lack of buyback robustness/legal protection) is going to be at the very least an emotional and volatile ride because it will be a constant push between greed and fear with no underlying certainty in the \"asset\" whatsoever.  The lack of token holder security through mechanics in place of the lack of legal protection is just not going to allow people to seriously invest in this.  For me (and im not telling anyone else to do) I sold today.  This is too sloppy for me to hold.  I hope they address this so I can get back in before launch.  Otherwise I will dedicate my money to platforms where the token is literally a necessary piece of the operation and therefore the value cannot be removed.  They build the platform and token completely segregated which was a mistake when legal protection for token holders is literally not even possible today.\n",

That was sort of revolutionary and one of the main ICN selling points too, and thrilled people (including me) quite a lot. Being so close to a security may cause some concerns and give ground to some pesky legal issues in the future. Does the simple fact they moved from a dividend-paying token to a buyback token remove those issues about ICN being a proxy to a security? Not at all. It only makes ICONOMI a bit less vulnerable on those allegations if someone eventually comes knocking at their door, along with relieving some pressure from exchanges who may consider ICN too hot to be listed.\n",

Exscudo wants to be the exchange for both buisnesses and common people. A bitliscence in New York would take a large sum of the money raised in the ICO (I don't recall how much). And that is just the state of New York operating legally, for the federal government it would be even more costly.

It is pegged (only) to BTC and does not react independently of this. Example: When BTC goes up, AE just stays the same in relation to BTC, actually also going up, since its only pegged to BTC. Considering the bad communication strategy of AE before the new CTO and no good news during that time, in a real market the relative price of AE/BTC should have went down, instead. Yet, the price actually tripled, because of BTC going up that much. So it doesnt really behave as a crypto in its own right on HitBTC. Similarly, the EOS IOU showed that HitBTC was actually a week late in connection the (fake market) IOU to the mainnet, which therefore had completely disconnected prices compared to actual trading on bitfinex and kraken. \n",

With a few notable exceptions, one of the biggest hurdles that a lot of ICO project put in from of themselves is only listing their tokens on 1 or maybe 2 exchanges with little to no volume.

Although I don’t know you personally, you have always striked me as one searching for the right balance of practicality and the power/expressiveness of a language. You clearly have built systems that scale massively, so I’m curious as to your current thoughts on languages. Back in 2014 you mention that you prefer Go these days over Erlang and for a while you had gone down the Ocaml route. I have tried Go, but I struggle with lack of expressiveness and verbosity compared to other languages. Perhaps this is where the practical portion of the equation trumps the power/expressiveness part.\n",

This is not so true IMO: *With the money we gave you months ago, you should have by now at least ten great developers in your offices banging this product out.* It's not just a matter of how much cash you have in the bank to throw around. There's a shortage of skilled blockchain devs because it takes time to learn it.

      "My question is about the bridge (or, in the case of aeternity thus far, chasm) between the tech and the real world.  Until this point, it seems as if the team has utterly failed to understand that the moment they solicited huge sums of money from investors, the game changed. They needed to step outside of their bubble and start acting like a world class tech company rather than teenage boys coding in their bedrooms. Yet this hasn't happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been little or no concern (or it certainly seems that way to everyone outside the confines of the aeternity office) about producing a blockchain on schedule, developing relationships with third parties, and making a significant impact on the crypto world.  And as a result, opportunities seem to have been missed. E.g. many upcoming ICOs are related to solving the issue of oracles and blockchain connectivity to the outside world, one of the key selling points of aeternity. Because aeternity has been slow, it's no longer going to have any first-to-market advantage. And even if the delays are inevitable, the organization has been silent when it comes to releasing marketing information to the world that would at least have mitigated any damage and put aeternity's stake in this territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team appears to have a bit of an \"aw shucks\" attitude and fails to understand the pace at which technology in this arena is progressing or how high the stakes have been raised now that the ICO has been completed.  Take the theft of the funds, for example.  The information released suggests to us that aeternity treated this as something as insignificant as losing twenty bucks while strolling around the mall. Sure, it was definitely a big deal to you all, but this wasn't conveyed.  I don't think an apology was even issued; all we saw was a general \"shit happens\" attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my point: what are you doing to impress upon the team that this isn't a game anymore, that it's a grown-up project with grown-up responsibilities?  What are you doing to bridge the gap between the tech side and the business side?\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't Field of Dreams.  If you build it, they won't come. Someone (and preferably a world-class team of marketing and outreach professionals) needs to be out there pounding the pavement, banging on doors, and getting this product front and center on the desks of CTOs in businesses across the globe.

Later today we will release a first stage p2p library component for decentralized poker, that other projects can tweak and use in their own decentralized poker projects  i.e projects like consensys since one of the first guys joe tried to recruit and I have not seen the tech reproduced.

These enhancements will be implemented *after* the refactoring stage is completed, and hopefully will make things even easier to use. On this note, the much anticipated AKASHA web-version will also come after this refactoring. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the collaboration side, during EDCON Paris I exchanged a few ideas with Vlad, Vitalik, Primavera and others regarding tokens, identity and reputation.

      "\n",
