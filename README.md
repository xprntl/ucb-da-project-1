# ucb-da-project-1

##Purpose

This project is an attempt to find out if there is a strong correlation between amount of money raised during an ICO and activity on social media related to that campaign. 
    
##Method

We have chosen Twitter and Reddit as sources for our data since those platforms tend to be places where people that are interested in or related to an ICO share updates and discuss opinions. 

After platforms were selected we scrapped all related tweets / campaigns and subjected them to sentiment analysis.
